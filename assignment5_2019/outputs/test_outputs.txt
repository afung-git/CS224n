You know that what I do is write for kids, and in fact, I'm probably the author for kids, more read in the United States.
And I always tell people that I don't want to look like a scientist.
I can dress up as a farmer or a leather clothes, and no one has ever chosen an agriculture.
I'm here today to talk to you about circles and epidemics.
And you know that an epiphany generally is something that you get in some place.
You just have to go back to the apple to see it as an epidemic.
That's the painting of a circle.
A friend of mine did that -- Richard Bollywood.
It's the kind of complicated circle that I'm going to talk about.
My circle started in the '60s in the middle school, in Steve, Ohio.
When they were beaten to bleeding every week in the children's bathroom, until a teacher saved my life.
She saved my life by letting me go into the teacher's bathroom.
I did it in secret.
For three years.
And I had to go from the city.
I had a thumb and 85 dollars, and I ended up in San Francisco, California -- I found a love -- and in the 1980s, I felt the need to start working in organizations that fought AIDS.
About three or four years ago, half the night I got a phone call of that teacher, Mr. Poster who said, "I need to see it.
I am disillusioned that we never get to know us.
You could come to Ohio and please.
And I have to tell you that I have pancreatic cancer, and I would like you to come with this please."
Well, the next day we were in Cleveland, OK.
We went to see it, we laugh, we cry, and we realized that she needed to be hospitalized.
We found a place, and we tried it, and we take it out of his family, because it was necessary.
It's something we knew how to do.
And as the woman I wanted to know as a adults came to me, it became a box of centers, and it was put in my hands.
And what happened was that the circle was closed, it had become a circle -- and that epidemic that I talked about was made in itself.
The epidemic is that death is part of life.
She saved my life, my partner and I saved her.
And you know that that part of life needs everything that the rest of life.
It needs truth and beauty, and I'm very happy today that I talked about this.
It also needs -- needs dignity, love and pleasure, and it's our work to provide those things.
Thank you.
As an artist, connection is very important for me.
Through my work, I'm trying to express that humans are not separated from nature and that everything is interconnected.
I first went to Antarctica about 10 years ago, and I saw my first mathematics.
I was amazing.
My heart fate fast, I was marine, trying to understand what was in front of me.
The mammography to me around the water was almost 60 meters, and I couldn't think more than thinking that it was a snipe of snow about another snow of snow after year.
The mathematics is born when they get rid of the glaciers or they break the ice bars apart.
Each iceberg has its own individual personality.
They have a different way to interact with their environment and their experiences.
Some of them are refused to give up and get sucked up until the end, whereas others can't get it more and develop into a dramatic passion.
It's easy to think, when you see a mathematical, that are isolated and solved, in large measure as we see us sometimes as humans.
But reality is all the opposite.
As a mathematician is dead, I'm breathing your ancestral atmosphere.
As a iceberg melt releases rich fresh water in minerals that feeds many forms of life.
I'm going to photograph these molecules as if it was about the portraits of my ancestors, knowing that in these unique moments there are that way and they won't exist that way again.
It's not the death when they're dead, it's not an end, but a continuation of its way for the cycle of life.
Part of the ice ice that photography is very young -- it has a couple thousand years old.
And another part of the ice has over 100,000 years.
The last pictures I'd like to show you are from a film that I photographed in Kevinder, Greenland.
It is very often going to be able to make a remarkable motor.
Here it is.
You can see the left a little boat.
It's about five feet.
And I'd like you to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and your floating line.
You can see here, it starts robotic, the ship has moved on the other side, and the man is standing there.
This is a temple of Greenland -- average size.
It comes out of the water about 120 feet or 40 feet.
This video is in real time.
And so non-states, the iceberg shows a different side of its personality.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine two couples in 1979, the same day, exactly at the same time, every one of them as a baby. Okay.
So, two couples each one with a baby.
I don't want you to stop too much in the details of consciousness, because if you stop thinking about consciousness itself, you're not going to pay attention.
Let's think about that for a moment.
And on this stage, I want you to imagine that, in a case, the chromosome and the sperm is joined by the X chromosome.
And in the other case, the X chromosome.
Both of them are going to go and start life.
We're going to talk about them later.
In my own activity I have two roles.
In one of my roles I work with the history of anatomy.
I'm a form of training, and what I study in this case is the way people go through the anatomy -- I mean, human bodies and animals, how the body fluid, the idea of the body, what have you thought about the body.
The other role that I play in my work is the activist, as a patient advocate or, as I say, sometimes, impact of people who are medical patients.
In this case, I've worked with people whose physical features defy social norms.
I've been working on for example, for example, six people, two people within the same body.
I've worked with people with any engineering, much lower than average.
And I've worked with a lot of cases of people with outliers, individuals whose physical technology doesn't fit in male and conventional female schools.
In general lines, we can call it interface.
The interface adopted a lot of ways.
I'm going to put some examples in ways of having a sex that is not locked into the male or female forms.
For example, there's the case of the individual computer baseline whose Stem Stem of the chromosome and tells the prototypes, which we all have in the fatal life, that are becoming testicles.
And then, in the heart life, the testicles produce testosterone.
But because this individual lacks of textbooks of testosterone, the body doesn't react to the same.
It's the syndrome of invisible invisibility.
So, there are high levels of testosterone, but without reaction.
As a consequence, the body is developed following a typically female course.
When the baby is born, the baby has a little girl.
It's a girl. It's raised as a child.
And often, it's not until puberty, when it's growing up and developing the siblings, but it doesn't have the menstrual period, when someone realizes that something is happening.
After doing tests you realize that instead of having ovarian and uterus, it actually has testicles and a chromosome.
The important thing to understand is that you may think it's a man, but it doesn't really look like this.
Women, like men, we have in the body something called supervision glands, right?
They're in the front part of the body.
Super-controlled glands produce agricultures, the manufacturing hormone.
Most women like me -- I consider a typical woman -- don't know their computer structure, I believe being a typical woman most of the women as I am sensitive to agricultures.
We produce agricultures and we respond to agricultures.
As a consequence, someone like me has the most exposed brain to the agreements that the woman who was born with testicles that have the syndrome.
And so sex is a complicated thing. It's not that the interactions are in the middle of the spectrum.
Another example: a few years ago, I got a call from a 19-year-old boy born and raised as you would see, had novel, and sexual relationships with her, led a life as a boy and just discovered that he had ovarian and signal.
It had an extreme form of a known disease as a supermarket supermarket hydrogen.
It had 20th chromosomes and in the uterus, the surface glands were so active that, essentially, they created a male hormone environment.
As a result, their geniuses were machinery -- their brain was exposed to the hormone technically male component.
He was born with a child aspect. No one was suspended anything.
And it was at the age of 19, when he started to have medical problems caused by internal menstrusive, when doctors discovered that, in fact, it was a woman in the inside.
Well, another quick example of a case of intelligence.
Some people with 20th chromosomes develop what is known as order, which is to say, they have a official tissue wrapped in terrible tissue.
We don't know why that happens.
So, there are lots of sex.
The reason why children with these kinds of bodies -- whether they are engineers, or smallestic twins, or interactive, are subjected to normal surgery is not so that we can make a better physical health.
In many cases, people are perfectly healthy.
The reason you get to various surgeries is that they're a threat for our social categories.
The system is normally based on the idea that a particular anatomy brings up a particular identity.
We have the idea that being women is to have female identity -- supposedly being black means to have African anatomy in historic terms.
A terribly simplistic idea.
And when you present a body that shows something pretty different, we have problems with cartoonist.
So we have very romantic ideas in our culture that we have in our culture.
Our nation is based on a very romantic concept.
Imagine how amazing it is to have children who are born as two people within a body.
The recent case is last year with the South African correct Carter Sex, and he put his sex in the International Banks Banks Banks.
Many journalists called to ask me, "What are you going to do to determine whether Qatar Sex is a man or a woman?"
And I had to explain to the journalists that there are no such test.
In fact, now we know that sex is so complicated that we have to admit that nature is not going to be a task between men and women or men and women and women and women and women and interactions, we are us who we treat that line.
So what we have is a situation where the more advanced the science, the more we have to admit that these categories -- which we thought were stable academic categories that correspond directly with stable identical categories.
And not just in terms of sex.
Also in terms of race, something that is much more complicated than the terminology allows you.
As we see, we get into a scarce terrain.
So look, for example, the fact that we share at least 95 percent of DNA with chimpanzees.
What would we think about the fact that they are in just a few nuclear periods?
And as we put progress in science, we get more and more in an awkward area where we have to recognize that the simple categories that we manage probably are too simplistic.
And we're looking at this in all the edges of human life.
One of them, for example, in our current culture, in the United States today, are the struggles at the beginning and at the end of life.
It's hard to look at a moment from which a body gets human, and it has different rights.
There are very limited discussions today -- maybe not in public, but I know within medicine -- it turns out when someone gets killed.
Our ancestors never had to look at them with this question of whether someone was dead.
As a lot of them put a pen in front of the nose, and if they were moving yet.
If I stopped moving it up.
But today, we can, for example, extract vital organs from a body and put them in another body.
And as a consequence, we need to face the dilemma to really determine somebody's death, and this puts us in a difficult situation where we don't have the simple categories of the past.
And you may think that this explosion of categories could get to someone like me.
In politics, I am a programmer, defining people with unusual bodies, but I have to admit that it puts me nervous.
And I will notice that these categories are much more unstable.
Think about the point of view of democracy.
And to tell you about this tension first, I have to admit that I'm an admiration of the founding parents.
I know they were racist -- I know they were sexually, but they were big.
I mean, they were so brave and auditions and so radical, what they did, that I find each so much as watching that music covered 777,000 and not because of music, which is totally possible.
That's why it happened in 1777 with the founding parents.
The founding fathers were, for me, the first activists of the anatomy and explained why.
What they rejected was an anatomical concept and replaced it with another one that was radical and beautiful and kept for 200 years.
And as everybody remembers what our founding parents were was the idea of monitoring. The monarchy was based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy.
The world's monitors don't know the DNA, but they had clear the idea of birth right.
They had the concept of blue blood.
They were from the idea that they came to the political power by the right of blood transmitted from the grandfather to father and then the son, etc.
The founding fathers rejected that idea and replaced it by a new anatomical concept, and that concept was that all men are created equal.
They looked at the game field and decided that the anatomy that mattered was the anatomy in common and not the atomic differences. That was a very radical thing.
And in part they were doing it because they were part of an intellectual system where two things were being spent.
The democracy was serving democracy and the same time was born science.
And it's very clear, if we look at the history of the founding parents, that many were very interested in science and in the idea of a natural world.
They were being distance from the supernatural explanations and therefore they rejected the concept of supernatural power that was transmitted by this idea of birth of birth.
They were moving towards a natural concept.
And if you look, for example, the Declaration of Independence, talk about nature and the god of nature.
They don't talk about God and the nature of God.
They talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are.
And in consequence they were turning up the idea of anatomical coincidence.
And by doing that, they were sitting the foundations of the future Civil Rights movement.
They didn't think about it, but they did it for us and it was great.
And what happened years later?
And women were survived.
Then came the success of the Civil Rights movement with people from the cartoon of Sorry Trick, who said, "I'm not a woman?
We found men on the lines of the Civil Rights movement saying, "I'm a man."
Again, people of color that applied to anatomical coincidence about anatomical difference and, again, they succeeded.
We see the same with the Discommanism movement.
The problem is, of course, as we look at the conferences, we have to start asking us why we keep certain dollars.
But attention, I want to maintain some anatomical divisions in our culture.
For example, I don't want to give a fish the same rights as a human.
I don't want to say that we should give us to the anatomy of it.
I don't mean that five year-old children were allowed to be allowed to have sexual relationships or married.
There are some anatomical divisions that make sense and that I think we should keep going.
But the challenge is to try to figure out what they are, why keep them and they make sense.
Well, let's go back to those two things that are focused on the beginning of this talk.
We have two beings, both of them in the middle of 1979, exactly the same day.
Imagine that one of them, Mary was born three months before time -- June 1, 1980.
Henry, in the contrary, was born in terms of the 1980s, was born.
For the only one of three months before Mary was attributed to all the rights three months before Henry -- the right to sexual consent, the right to the vote, the right to drink.
Henry has to wait for all of that not because it has a different biological age, but because it was born later.
So we found other rare in relation to their rights.
Henry, in virtue of being considered man, while I haven't told you if it's XB: In virtue of being considered man now is the mandatory religion that Mary doesn't have to worry about.
Mary on his part, doesn't have the same rights to marriage that Henry in all states, for example.
Henry can marry all states with a woman, but Mary can marry a woman just in some states.
So you still have anti-cancer categories that in many ways are problematic and questionable.
And now the question is: What do we do now that science advanced so much in the field of the anatomy that we have to admit that a democracy based on anatomy could demand?
I don't want to give up science, but at the same time sometimes I feel like science is being thrust up.
Where are we going?
It seems like what happens in our culture is sort of a pragmatic attitude -- "Well, we have to trace the line somewhere, so we're going to do it."
But a lot of people are trapped in a rare position.
For example, Texas at a certain time has decided that to marry a man you don't have to have chromosomes and that to marry a woman, you have to have chromosome.
Now, in practice, they don't do any chemistry to people.
But this is also very strange given the story that told them at the beginning of the synthesizer of the agency to the agreements.
If you look at one of the founding parents of modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King, in his speech, "I have "Don't "do "Don't Dead a solution.
It says that we should judge people not in the color of their skin, but in the content of their career: getting beyond the anatomy.
And I mean, "Yes, the idea seems very good.
But in practice, how does it do?
How do you judge people based on the content of their care?
I want to point out that I'm not sure that we should be based on this to make sure rights to people, because I have to admit that I know about some of some soled glasses that probably deserve more social services than some humans I know.
I also want to say that maybe some collaborators that I know can make more informed decisions, smart and mature decisions about their sexual relationships that I know.
So how do you put it in practice the issue of the character content.
It turns out very hard.
And one part of me is wondering what happens if the character of a person could be measured with an instrument, maybe with a magnetic resonance of it.
Do we really want to get to that point?
I'm not sure where we go.
What I know is that it seems to be very important that the United States is still guiding this kind of thinking of thinking about democracy.
We've done a good job in defense of democracy, and I think we'll make a good job in the future.
We don't live, for example, in a context like the Iranian where a man who feels attracted by other men is susceptible to be killed, unless it's willing to stay to a sex change, which case it's allowed to live.
We're not in that situation.
I'm glad to say that we don't have a context like a surgeon that I talked about a couple of years ago that I had made a couple of years ago, and then separate them and so to get their fame in.
But when the phone asked him the reason of the operation -- it was a very risky operation, I was told that in that other country, these kids would be very massively with it, and therefore I had to do it.
What I said, "Well, has the political asylum.
America offers huge possibilities to people to be who they are not forcing them to change for the sake of the state.
So I think we need to be to the head.
Well, in closing, I mean I've been talking a lot about parents.
And I want to think about what democracy would be, or as it might have been, if we had given more participation to mothers.
And I want to say something a little bit radical, and it is that I think there may be different ideas coming from different anatomical telescopes, particularly if there are people thinking about groups.
For years, since years I've been interested in interaction, I've also been interested in investigating the sexual difference.
And one of the things that has been interested in is the differences between men and women in the way to think and operate in the world.
And what we know about momentous studies is that women, in average, not all, but in average, they tend to pay more attention to complex social relationships and to occupy those who are vulnerable within the group.
And if we think about that, we have an interesting situation in our hands.
A few years ago, when I was in the graduate school, one of my advisers I knew I was interested in the feminist -- I considered me feminist -- like now, I made a strange plan."
"Tell me what the feminist has for female."
And I thought, "It's the most stupid question I've ever heard.
The feminist has to do with taking gender stereotypes, so there's nothing female in female."
But the more I've thought about your question, the more it has seemed to me that there is something female in feminism here.
I mean, there might be something, in average, something different between the female brain and the male that makes us more attention to complex social relationships and willing to help the most vulnerable.
So if the parents were very keen to find a way to protect people in the state of the state, it's possible that to have invented more mothers to this concept, maybe we would have enriched the concept of protection with the reciprocal support.
And maybe that's what we need to do in the future when we take democracy beyond analogy: thinking less in the individual body, in terms of identity, and thinking more about relationships.
So as we try to create a more perfect one, think about what we do for each other.
Thank you.
In 2007, I decided we had to rethink how we think about economic development.
Our new goal should be that when every family thinks where it wants to go to live and work, it has the possibility of choosing between at least a handful of different cities that are competing to attract new residents.
Well, right now, we are far away from that goal.
There are billions of people in developing countries that don't count with a single city willing to get them.
But the amazing thing about cities is that they are much more than their construction cost.
So we could easily deliver the world, maybe hundreds of new cities.
Well, this can sound absurd if they've never thought about new cities.
But just replace them for apartment buildings.
Imagine that half of those who would want to live in apartments already were prices and that the other half will still be missing.
They could try to increase the ability to make expectations in all existing buildings.
But you know that the problem that you'll face is that those buildings and the areas that surround them have rules to avoid the molecules and the distribution of construction.
So it would be very difficult to do all those expansion.
But they could go to a whole new place, build a whole new apartment building, always and when the rules of that place make the construction instead of putting them out.
So I proposed that governments created new enough areas of big enough to contain cities, and I gave them a name, cities under the story.
I later learned that about the same time, James and October were thinking about the challenge of refusing Honduras.
They knew that every year about 75,000 holes would come out of their country to go to the United States, and they wanted to ask what they could do to make sure that those people could stay and do those same things in Honduras.
In the summer of 2009, 2004 went through a desktop conservation crisis.
In the next regular elections, Peter Louis is extremely imposed with a platform where it promises reforms and at the same time.
He asked October to be his head of wind.
Meanwhile, I was preparing to give a TEDTalk talk.
Through a process of perfect, trial and error and a huge number of tests with users, tried to reduce this complicated concept of cities under the state of their most essential ideas.
The first point was the importance of norms, like those rules that say that you can't go and bother all the current approaches of apartments.
We pay a lot of attention to new technologies, but it takes so much of technologies like rules to progress and usually are the rules that prevent us forward.
In the fall of 2010, a friend of Guatemala sent to October a link with the TEDTalk.
I showed it to Javan.
They called me.
They said, "Let's get this to the leaders of our country."
So in December, we met in Miami in a conference room from a hotel.
I tried to explain this point about how valuable cities, much more valuable than their monetary cost.
And I used this image that shows the value of the land in a place like New York. Look at it, in some cases, are worth thousands of dollars per square meter.
But it was a pretty abstract discussion and at some point, when there was a pause, Oliver said, "Paul, maybe we could see the TED talk video.
And the talk described in very simple terms, that a very simple city is a place where you start with slides supported, a statue that specifies the rules that will apply there and an option for people to choose whether they want to go or not live under those norms.
So the president of Honduras.
I was asked to go to School and talk about four and five of the January.
So I presented another talk full of data, which included an image like this, which was trying to explain that to generate a lot of value to a city, this has to be very big.
This is a picture of Dennishes, and the white line is the new airport that was built in Dennisha.
Only this airport covers over 100 square miles.
So I was trying to convince the holes that to build a new city, you have to start with a site that measures at least 1,000 square miles.
That's more than 100,000 acres.
Everybody was catching completely.
The audience faces were very serious and stress.
The Congress leader came up to the platform and said, "Professor Roman, thank you very much for your talk, but maybe you could see the video of the TEDTalk.
I have here in my computer."
So I sat down and showed the TEDTalk.
And this explains the essentials that a new city can offer new choices for people.
There would be a choice from a city to which you might be in Honoise, rather than hundreds of miles away.
And it also includes new options for leaders.
Because the London government leaders need help of associated countries, they could benefit from the associated countries that would help them establish and make the rules of the statue, so that everybody could trust that the statue effectively breaks up.
We went and saw a site.
This picture is there.
It could easily run about a thousand square miles.
And shortly after the 19th of January, they voted in Congress to test their Constitution and add a constitutional device that allows us to create these special development regions.
In a country that was just going through this painful crisis, the voting in the Congress in favor of this constitutional transmission was 145 to one.
All of the parties, all the patterns in society, they showed it.
To include the Constitution, you have to take two times in Congress.
On February 17, again in another voting from 1941.
Immediately after the voting of the vote, from 21st to 24, a delegation of about 30 holes went to the two places in the world that are more interested in participating in the construction of cities.
One is Korea from South Korea.
This is a picture of a new center of the city that's building in South Korea -- it's bigger than the center of Boston.
Everything you see there was built in four years, after they spent four years getting the permission.
The other country interested in building cities is Singapore.
In fact, they've already built two cities in China and they're preparing for a third.
And if you think about this, this is the point where we are.
They have a website, and they're already thinking about a site for the second city.
They're preparing a legal system that will allow the administrators to come, and at the same time allow them to operate under an external legal system.
A country has already committed to allow his Supreme Court to be the last instance for this new court system.
There are urban urbanism and cities that are very interested in the project.
You can even get some funding.
But the only thing we know that they've already solved is that they have a good number of inhabitants.
There are a lot of companies that would like to install the Americas, especially in a place with a free crime zone, and there are a lot of people who would like to go to live there.
In the world there are 700 million people who say that they would immediately change another place.
There's a million a year that comes out of Latin America to go to the United States.
Many of them are parents who have to leave their family to go to get a job, sometimes they are solar mothers who have to earn money to just eat or buy clothes.
Sadly, sometimes even children are trying to meet with their parents who haven't seen, in some cases, in a decade.
So what does it seem to be thinking about building a new city in Houses?
Or build a dozen of these, or a hundred of these around the world?
What does it seem to be thinking about insisting so that families can choose between various cities that are competing to attract new responsibilities?
This is an idea worth spreading.
And my Indian friends asked me to say, "Thank you TED.
I'm Jesse and this is my value.
But before I show you what there is inside, I'm going to make a public confession -- and that's that I live obsessed with the suit.
I love to find, dress, and more recently, photograph and publish on my blog suits. Colors and different for each occasion.
But I don't buy anything new.
All my clothes is a second hand of banks and second hand stores.
Ah, thank you.
The second hand stores allow me to reduce the impact of my throat in the environment and in my bill.
I get to know interesting people, usually my money goes to a good cause. My partner is unique, and buy it becomes my personal search search for test.
I mean, what am I going to find today?
I will be my store?
Will the color like color.
Is it cost less than 20 dollars?
If all answers are positive, then I feel that I've won.
Going back to the theme of my value, I want to tell you what I made for this exciting week at TED.
I mean, what do you bring in all that clothes?
So I'm going to show you exactly what I brought in.
I've brought seven pairs of inner clothes, and nothing else.
Robot interior for exactly a week is all I've put in my valley.
I imagine that it would be able to find everything else I'd like to use after getting here to Palm Springs.
And because they don't know me as the woman who walks for TED in inner clothes,  that means I found some things.
And I'd like to show you now for this week.
Doesn't it sound interesting?
As I do, I'm also going to tell you some of the lessons of life that, believe it or not, I've learned in this adventure of not using new clothing.
Let's start with Sunday.
This is what I call a bright tiger.
You don't have to spend a lot of money to look good.
You can always see you phenomenal for less than 50 dollars.
All of the together, including the jacket, cost me 25, and it's the most expensive I've ever used on the week.
Monday, color is energy.
It's almost physically impossible to be in a bad mood, when you're looking at a brilliant red painting.
If you're happy, you're going to attract other happy people.
Martis: The integration is survived.
I've spent a lot of time in life trying to be myself and at the same time.
I just know yourself.
If you're surrounded from the right people, not only will you understand you, you will also appreciate you.
Michael: Google of the child you take inside.
Sometimes people tell me that they seem to play the discoveries, or I remember their little seven years.
I like to smile and say, "Thank you."
Rives: The trust is the key.
If you think you see you well with something, it's almost sure you are.
And if you think you don't see you well with something, it's probably true.
My mother taught me this day after day.
But it wasn't until the 30 years that I really understood their meaning.
And I'm going to explain it in a few seconds.
If you think you're a beautiful person in your inner and outside, you don't see you can't attract you.
So there's no excuse for anybody from this audience.
We should be able to achieve everything we want to achieve.
Thank you.
Friday seven, a universal truth six words for you: The sports legs go all over it.
And finally, white -- develop a personal and unique style of telling the world something about you without having to say a word.
I've tried it over and over again when people came to me this week simply by what I was using -- and we had fantastic conversations.
Obviously all of this isn't going to go into my little value.
So before I go home, to Brooklyn, I'm going to donate everything.
Because the lesson I'm trying to learn this week is that you have to leave a certain thing.
I don't need to embrace these things, because the back of the corner, there will always be another crazy suit, colorful and bright waiting for me, if there's a little love in my heart and looking for.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is a representation of your brain that we can split in two parts.
The left side, which is the logical side, and the right side, which is the intuitive part.
So if we were using a scale to measure the altitude of every hemisphere, we could design a blueprint of our brain.
For example, this would be someone who is completely logical.
This would be somebody who's totally intuitive.
So where would you take your brain on this scale?
Some of them are going to be opened by one of these ends, but I think for most of the integrate of this audience, your brain is something that -- with a great application in both hemisphere at the same time.
It's not that they're mutually exclusive.
You can be logical and intuitive.
I consider one of those people, that most of the other experimental quantum physicists, we need quite a lot of logic to make these complicated ideas.
But at the same time, we need quite a lot of intuition to make experiments really work.
How do we develop this intuition? Well, we like to play with things.
We're going to play with them, and then we see how they react and then we develop our intuition from that point.
And actually, you do the same thing.
A certain intuition that you can have developed with the past of the years is that one thing can be just in a place at a time.
I mean, it can sound weird to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time, but you weren't born with this notion, they developed it.
I remember looking at a child playing in a parking bar.
It was a small child, and I didn't do it very well, always hands.
But I bet that playing with that parking bar is taught a valuable lesson, and it is that big things don't allow the transportations, and they stay in a place.
This is a great conceptual model that you can have in the world, except you are a particle physics.
It would be a terrible model for a particle physicist, because they don't play with parking bars and play with these strange particles.
And when they play with their particles, discover that they do all kinds of really rare things -- like they can go through walls, or they can be in two different places at the same time.
And then they wrote all these observations and they called it quantum mechanics.
At that point, the physics was found a few years ago, you need quantum mechanics to describe those little particles.
But you didn't need to describe the big objects that surround us every day.
That didn't fit very well to my intuition, and maybe it's because I don't play very often with particles.
Well, sometimes I play with them, but not a lot.
And I've never seen them.
I mean, no one saw a particles.
But it didn't really fit my logical part.
Because if everything is made out of little particles and all the small particles follow the principles of quantum mechanics, then shouldn't it all follow the principles of quantum mechanics, right?
I don't find the reason why it shouldn't be.
And so I would feel much better if I could somehow demonstrate that a common object also follows the principles of quantum mechanics.
That's why a few years ago, I proposed to do exactly that.
And I did.
This is the first object that you can see that has been in a quantum mechanics.
What we see here is a little computer chip.
And you can try to see the green dot right in the middle.
That's the metal piece I'm going to talk about in a minute.
This is a picture of the object.
And here I'm going to expand it a little bit. It's right in the center.
And then here we do a well big approach to the little piece of metal.
What we see is a small little bit of metal -- a form of transportation and it will be supported in a platform.
And so I did this almost the same way you would do a computer chip.
I went to a clean room with a new silicon chip, and I put all the big machines for about 100 hours.
For the last material, I had to build my own machine -- to make this original point of swimming, which is under the device.
This device has the ability to be in a quantum superconductor, but it needs a little bit of help.
Let me make an analogy.
You know how uncomfortable it is to be in an elevator full of people.
I mean, when I'm in an elevator alone, I do all kinds of weird things, but then when other people go up to stop doing those things, because I don't want to bother them, or actually stay.
Quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects behave the same way.
The travel partners of inanimate objects are not just people, it's also the light that shines it and the wind that happens next and the heat of the room.
So we knew that if we wanted this little bit of metal to be built according to quantum mechanics, we would have to express all the other passengers to it.
And that's what we did.
We took the lights off, then we introduced a vacuum and removed all the air, and then we face it to a temperature of less than a degree on the absolute zero.
Now, when you're just in the elevator -- the little piece of metal is free to act as you want.
So we measured their movements.
We discovered that it moves in very strange ways.
Instead of staying perfectly still, I was vibrating -- and the way he was vibrating was like a breath in this way -- as a food that expands and contributes.
And when you give it a soft suit, we could make it vibrate and not fly at the same time -- something that only happens with quantum mechanics.
So what I'm telling you is something really fantastic.
What does it mean that a flying thing and doesn't fly at the same time?
Let's think about atoms.
In a case, all of the atoms of atoms that make that metal piece are single and at the same time those same atoms are moving up and down.
It's just in particular details when those are alive.
In the rest of the time they're clearly.
It means that every atom is in two different places at the same time, which means all the metal piece is in two different places.
I think this is great.
Seriously.
It was worth getting me in a clean room to do this for all of those years, because, look at this, the scale difference between one atom and that little bit of metal is roughly the same as the difference between that piece of metal and you.
So if one single atom can be in two different places at the same time, and that piece of metal can be in two different places, why don't you too?
I mean, it's my logical part of it.
So imagine if you were in various places at the same time, what would that be?
How do you act your consciousness if your body was saved in space?
There's another part of the story.
And it's when we heat it, and we turn the lights and we looked inside the box, we saw that the metal followed there in a single piece.
And I could get to this new intuition -- apparently all the objects in the elevator are actually just quantum objects that are just made in a small space.
You hear a lot about how quantum mechanics claims that everything is interconnected.
Well, that's not that true.
It's more than that, it's deeper.
And that is that those connections, your connections to all the things that surround you, literally define who you are, and that's the deep root of quantum mechanics.
Thank you.
My name is Amy here.
And 18 months ago, I did another job in Google, until I launched the idea of doing something related to museums and art to my boss that is here and that allowed me to take it to it.
It took me 18 months.
Many negotiations and stories, I assure it, with 17 very interesting museums of nine countries.
But I'm going to focus on it.
There are a lot of stories of why we did.
I think my own story is explained simply in this slide, and this is access.
I grew up in India.
I hit a great education -- I didn't complain -- but I didn't have access to many of these museums and artwork.
So when I started traveling and going to museum, I started learning a lot.
And working on Google, I try to make the desire to make it more accessible by technology.
So we formed a team, a great team of people, and we started doing it.
And better than showing you a couple of things to explain a couple of interesting things that we've carried out of their launch.
So simply, let's go to Google.
Look around all the museums that there are.
There's the Gallon Gallery, the MoMA, the Emmanino, the Redwood, the Google Van Google.
I actually go into one of my favorites, to Mexico, the Museum of Art in New York.
There are two ways to do it -- very simple.
We click and came, we're already inside the museum.
No matter where they are, Mumbai or McDonald, that doesn't really matter.
You move around and you're fun.
Do you want to navigate the museum.
We open up the top plane, and with a single click, we jump into it.
They're inside, they want to go at the end of the hall.
They go forward. They diverse."
Explore.
Thank you, but I haven't come to the best.
Now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings, "The Council of Pick Britain in the Metrick.
I see the sign B.
If the museum shows us the image, we click there.
Look, this is one of the images.
Here is all the data of metaphors.
For those of you who are really interested in art, you can click there, but I'm going to click here right now.
And this is one of the images that we've captured in what we call the general technology.
So this image, for example, contains -- I think, about 10,000 pixels of pictures.
And there are many people who ask me, "What do you get with 10,000 pigs of pictures?
So I'm going to show you what you really get with 10,000 pigs.
It can make sleep around a very simple way.
You see fun things that are happening.
I love this guy, his expression has no price.
But if you really want to go down.
So I started playing, and I found something that happened there.
And I said, "A moment, this seems interesting.
I went into and discovered that children were actually playing something.
I went up a little bit, I talked to some people from the Metrick, and I actually discovered that this is a game called "normal "normal," which is to hit a hole with a stick of Caribbean.
And apparently it was very popular.
I don't know why they did, but I've learned something about it.
And now we're going to get even deeper in deep and see that you can actually get to the cracks.
Now just to give you a little bit of perspective, I'm going to get up the image, so you'll see what there is.
This is where we were, and this is the painting.
The best thing is to come, a second.
So now we're going to quickly jump to the MoMA in New York.
Another one of my favorites, "The night started."
The example I showed was to find detail.
But what if you want to see the picked?
And if you want to see how Dan Google actually created this teacher work?
I increase it and really do it.
I go to one of my favorite parts in this painting, and I'm really going to get to the cracks.
This is "The Story Night," I think I had never seen it so before.
I'm going to show you another one of my favorite function.
There are many things beyond here, but I don't have time to show you.
This is the really cool part. It's called "Constants."
All of you, absolutely all, doesn't matter whether it's rich or poor, or if you have a song, that gives you the same.
You can online your own museum, create your own collection from all these images.
It's very simple, we come in, and I've created this function that I call "The Earth Power: -- we just made a zoo around it.
It's about "The Boomers National Gallery in London.
You can put things together, send it to your friends and keep a conversation about what you feel when you're contemplating these master workers.
So in conclusion, I think for me, the main thing is that all incredible things don't really come from Google.
No, in my opinion, they even don't come from museums either.
Maybe I shouldn't say this.
They actually come from those artists.
And that has been my humble experience with this.
I mean, I hope that in this digital medium I do justice to your art work, and it's represented properly online.
And the big question they do today is, "Do you do this to repeat the experience of going to a museum, "I say?
And the answer is no.
It's to supplement the experience.
And that's it. Thank you.
Thank you.
Good afternoon.
I have something to show you.
You think it's a picture, a flying picture.
In our lab, we call it responsive design.
I'm going to tell you a little bit about this.
If you look at this picture -- I'm from Italian origin -- all children in Italy grow up with this picture on the wall of your bedroom. But the reason I show you this is that there's something very interesting in the shores of Freud 1 in the last two decades.
So some time ago, if you wanted to win a Fortune one, you would take a budget and put it to a good pilot and a good car.
If the car and the pilot were good enough, you won the race.
This is what engineering is called real-time control.
It's essentially a system that has two components, a sensor and a accident.
The interesting thing is that the real-time control systems are starting to get into our lives.
Our cities, in the last few years, have been covered with networks and electronics.
They're becoming computer air computers.
And as such, they're starting to respond differently, and they can be detected and accidentally.
According cities is a big thing.
As I notice, I wanted to mention that cities are only two percent of the planet cortex, but they represent 50 percent of the world's population.
75 percent of the energy consumption -- and to 80 percent of CO2 emissions.
If we could do something with cities, it would be a big thing.
Beyond cities, all these detectors and activities are entering our everyday objects.
This is from a Palami Annote exhibition for the end of the year at MoMA during the summer.
It's called "The Uncle Uncle "The Mosque "The Toy!
Well, our objects, the environment, start to talk to us.
In a way, it's like almost all the existing atoms become sensors and actions.
And that's changing the interaction that we as humans have with the outside environment.
In a sense, it's almost like in the old dream of Michillage Angeles.
You know, when Michael sculpted the Mosson, he says that at the end, he took the hammer, and he threw it to the Moses -- he can still see a little bit of a box under and he said, "Peace not pay?
Well, today, for the first time, our environment starts to talk to us.
And I'm going to show you just a few examples, looking at the idea of capturing the environment and action something.
Let's start with detection.
The first project I wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects of our lab.
This was four and a half years ago in Italy.
It was a summer of 2006.
It was the year that Italy won the World Cup Columb.
Maybe some of you remember it, they played Italy and France, and at the end of the West gave the head.
And anyway, at the end won Italy.
Now let's see what happened that day looking at activity happened on the network.
Here we see the city.
You see the College in the middle and the Tree River.
It's tomorrow, before the game.
The time line is at the top.
And in the early afternoon, there are people over here and there doing call, moving.
It starts the party," silence.
Golden of France.
So entertainment, people make a quick call and go to the bathroom.
Second time. End of the rule time.
First extra time, second.
Wildlife, and in a moment, the head.
Dang Italy, yeah.
That night everybody went to celebrate the center.
There you see the big peak.
The next day everyone went to the center to the winning team and the first minister of then.
And then everybody went down.
You see the image of the place called City Massachusetts where, from the Roman time, people will celebrate -- it's a big party, you can see the peak at the end of the day.
This is just an example of how we can measure the pulse of the city in a way that we couldn't do just a few years ago.
Another quick example of detection is not about people, but of things we use and consume them.
Today we know all about the procedure of our objects.
This is a map that shows all the chips that make a Mac, how they assemble it.
But we know very little about where things go.
So in this project, we developed some small tags to track the trash in their disaster by the system.
We started with a few volunteers that helped us in Seattle a little over a year ago, to label what they were throwing out -- different kinds of things, as you can see, things that would anyway.
And then we put a little chip, a tag to the trash and then we started tracking it.
These are the results.
Get from Seattle.
After a week.
With this information, we realized that there are lots of innovations in the system.
We can do the same with much less energy.
These are data that you didn't exist.
They're happening complicated things, and there's a lot of unnecessary transportation.
But the other thing that we believe is that if we look at every day that the cup that we draw doesn't disappear, it's still somewhere on the planet.
That if the plastic bottle that we shine one day is still there.
And if we show that to people, then we can promote some behavior change.
That was the reason of the project.
My colleague of MIT, Astra Bible, could tell us much more about detecting and many other things that we can do with that, but I wanted to go to the second part we mentioned at the beginning, which is to act on the environment.
And the first project is something we did a couple of years ago in Zaprincry.
It all started with a question of the mayor of the city, which came and told us that Spain and South Europe have a beautiful tradition of water use in public spaces, in architecture.
And the question was, how can the technology, the new technology, to join that?
And one of the ideas that we developed at MIT, in a workshop was, imagine that they have a fall and valves of solid, slides that are open and closed.
It's created as a water current, with water pixels with water.
If you get the pixels off you can write in them, show patterns, images, text.
And when you zoom in, the curtain will open up so that we can happen, as you see in the picture.
We presented this to the Bell mayor here.
He liked a lot.
And it took a commission to design the building at the entrance of the Expect.
We call it Digital Water Pales.
The whole building is made of water.
There are no doors or windows -- but when you open it up, you can get you to happen.
The roof is also covered with water.
And if there's a little bit of wind, if you want to minimize the salaries, the roof goes down.
Or you can close the building and all the architecture disappears, like in this case.
And that day there will always be someone in the winter when they go down the roof, someone who was there and said, "Democratic the building.
No, it's not that they have dementia, but when it goes down almost all the architecture disappear.
Here is in work.
You see people who are intrigued by what's going on.
And here I am myself trying to not get us to test the sensors that open water.
I think I should tell you what happened one night when all the sensors stopped working.
That night was actually even more fun.
Every child in Zarray came to the building, because the way to interact had changed a little bit.
It was no longer a building that was open to let it happen, but a building I kept making corrupts and water holes and you had to jump to not get wet.
(And for us that was very interesting because as architects, engineers, designers, always think about using people to give us our designs.
But then reality is always unpredictable.
And that's the beauty of doing things to interact with, that people use.
This is a picture of the building with physical pixels -- water pixels and projections about them.
And this is what led us to think about the next project I'm going to show you.
Imagine that those pixels could start flying.
Imagine that they could have little helicopters in the air, and that each one had a little pixel that changes color as if it was a cloud that moves in space.
This is the video.
Imagine a helicopter like what we saw earlier, which moves with other silence.
We could form this cloud.
A kind of flexible screen like this with a normal configuration in two dimensions.
Or normal, but in three dimensions, what changes is light, not the position of pigs.
You can play with a different guy.
Imagine the screen will appear in different scales and sizes.
And that then all of that could be a 3D pixels that you can zoom in, and go back, and see from very different angles.
This is the real controlled Florida, going down to form a Viet, like before.
When you turn the light, you see this -- the same thing we saw before.
Imagine each of them controlled by one person.
We can have every pixel with an entrance that comes from people, from the movement of people, etc., etc.
I want to show you something for the first time.
We've been working with Robert Bollywood -- one of the best ballet dancers today, the Metrollowing star of New York and the Millennium Space -- to capture its 3D movements and use them as a input for the Florida.
Here we can see Robert dancing.
On the left you see the pixels -- the capture in different resolution.
It's so much digital digital in real time as a movement capture.
It can rebuild all the movement.
You can take all the way.
And once we have the pixels we can play with them, the color and the movement, with gravity and robot.
We want to use this as a possible entry for the Florida.
I wanted to show you the last project that we're working on.
It's something for the London Olympics.
It's called the Cleun.
And the idea is, imagine again, that we could engage people to do something and change our environment -- just like a cloud of cloud -- like the grain of gravity, but with a cloud.
Imagine that we could make everybody win a little bit for an incentive.
And I think what has happened in the last couple of years is that, in the last two decades, we went from the physical world to the digital world.
We've digitized everything, like knowledge, and it's accessible through the Internet.
Today, for the first time -- and the Obama campaign showed us, we can move from the digital world, the self-organizing power of networks, the physical world.
In our case, this might want to use it to design and make a symbol.
That would mean something built in a city.
But tomorrow can be to address the challenges of today, think about climate change or CO2 emissions -- how do you move from digital world to the physical world?
The idea is that we can make people involved in doing this together, collectively, collective form.
The cloud is a cloud, again, made of pixels in the same way that the real cloud is a particle cloud.
And those particles are water, whereas in our cloud they're pictures.
It's a physical structure in London, but it covered pigs.
You can move on the inside, have different experiences.
You can see from the bottom, to serve to share the main moments of the Olympics of 2012 and even more, and it can be used as a form of connection with the community.
So it's so much a physical cloud of the sky as something that you can rise, as a new top of London.
You can get there.
Like a new digital factor at night, but the most important thing is that it will be a new experience for anyone who goes to the top.
Thank you.
Would you like to be better than you are?
Suppose I told you that, with only a few changes in their genes, they could improve memory -- for a more precise, more accurate and faster.
Or maybe they would like to be in better way, to be stronger, to have more resistance.
Would you like to be more attractive and confident of yourself.
How about living more with good health?
Or maybe those people who always wanted to be more creative.
What else would you like it?
What would you like if you could choose something?
(Audience: Creativity." Creativity creation.
How many people choose creativity?
Raise your hand. Let me see.
So few. You probably owe the number of creative people present.
That's very good.
How many choose memories?
A few more.
What about the physical state.
A little less.
How about an anger?
Ah, most of it makes me feel very well as a doctor.
If you could have something about it, the world would be very different.
Is it just imaginable?
Or maybe possibly possible?
Evolution has been a subject here at the TED Conference but today I want to give you the look of a doctor on the subject.
The great generation of the 20th century, TED Jopy, who was also engaged in the Russian Orthodox Church, wrote a test called "Nature in biology makes sense except to the light of evolution.
But if they effectively accept biological evolution consider this: is it just about the past, or the future?
Does it mean to others or us?
This is another look at the tree of life.
The human part of this branch -- well on an extreme one, is, of course, the one that we're interested in.
We went from a common ancestor with modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago.
There have been maybe 20 or 25 different species of homosexuals.
Some of you have gone back and forth.
We've been here about 130 years.
It might seem to be very far from other parts of this tree of life, but actually, most of our cells the basic machinery of our cells is about the same.
Do you realize that we can harness and control the machinery of a common bacteria to produce the protein of human insulin that is used to treat diabetes?
This is not like human insulin -- but it's the same protein -- chemically indiscriminating, which comes out of the pancreas coming out of it.
And talking about bacteria -- realize that we all take in the most bacteria that we have in the rest of the body?
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean, think -- when Antonio Ramber asks you the anger -- think about bacteria?
The gut is a wonderfully hospital environment for those bacteria.
It's warm, dark, humb, it's very accumulation.
And we're going to provide all the nutrients that you can want to want without effort in your side.
It's really like a quick pathway for bacteria with the occasional disruption of some force towards the sale.
But of course, we are a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they are essential to our life.
They help demand essential nutrients, and they protect us from certain diseases.
But what does the future get us?
Are we in a kind of evolutionary equilibrium as a species?
Or are you destined to become something different, something maybe better adapted to the environment?
In this vast iconic symphony of the universe, life on Earth is like a brief company, the animal kingdom, as one and unique company, and human life, a little note of grace.
That was us.
And it was also the whole part of this talk, so I hope you've enjoyed it.
When I went to college, I had my first kind of biology.
I was fascinated by the elegance and beauty of biology.
I fell in love with the power of evolution, and I realized something fundamental -- most of the existence of life, in the single-celled organisms, each cell is simply divided and all the genetic energy of that cell is transmitted to the two daughters characteristics.
But when the multicellular organisms appear.
It comes into scene the sexual reproduction.
And something very important, with the emergence of sexual reproduction.
In fact, you could say that the inevitable death of the body goes into evolution in the same moment of sexual reproduction.
I have to tell you that when I was a college student, I thought, well, self-reporting, death, death per sex, it seemed pretty reasonable at that time, but with every year I had more doubt.
I got to understand George Burged feelings, which was still in Las Vegas in his 90 years.
And one night someone hits their hotel door.
He opens the door.
And in front of it is a gorgeous dancing dance of clothes.
He looks at it and he says, "I came in search for a sex shoe."
"It's right." He says, "George, I chose the soup."
I realized, as a doctor, that I was working on a different goal to the goal of evolution, not necessarily contracting, just different.
I was trying to preserve the body.
I wanted us to stay healthy.
I wanted to recover health in disease.
I wanted us to live more and healthier.
Evolution is to pass the genome to the next generation, adapting and survival generation after generation.
From an evolutionary point of view, you and I are like refrigerator rockets designed to send the genetic load to the next level, and then let us fall into the sea.
I think we will all understand the feeling that Woody Allen expressed when he said, "I don't want to achieve the immortality.
I want to make it not dying."
Evolution doesn't necessarily favor longevity.
It doesn't necessarily favor the largest or the strongest or the faster, and not even the most smart.
Evolution favors the best adapted to their environment.
That's the only proof of survival and success.
At the bottom of the ocean the extreme bacteria that can survive the heat of the female forms that would produce if there were fish there, fish made out of the vacuum.
So what does this mean when we look at what's happening in evolution, and if we think about the place of humans in evolution, and in particular, if we look forward to the following phase -- I would say there are a lot of possibilities.
The first is we don't evolve.
We've reached a kind of balance.
And the underlying reasoning would be that through medicine, first of all, we've been able to preserve a lot of genes that would otherwise have been discovered and eliminated from the population.
And secondly, as a species, we have confirmed our environment for us to adapt to us as well as we adapt to him.
And by the way, we migrated -- we circle, and we get so much complicated that no longer is that we have the isolation necessary for evolution.
A second possibility is that you produce an evolution of the traditional type, natural, imposed by the forces of nature.
And the argument here would be: that evolution of evolution will roll down, but they're interactive.
And in the insulation: when as a species we put distant planets there will be the isolation and the environmental changes that can produce evolution in a natural way.
But there's a third possibility -- an attractive possibility and intriguing and frightening.
The name of the neurological, new evolution, which is not simply natural -- but guided and chosen for us as individuals in the decisions that we will take.
Now, how could this happen?
How could we do this?
We first consider the reality that many people today, in some cultures, are making decisions about their offspring.
In some cultures, they're choosing to have more variations than women.
It's not necessarily good for society but it's what is choosing at the individual and family level.
Think that if it could be possible to be able to choose not just the sex of its description, but in its own body to make genetic adjust to cure or prevent disease.
What if we could do genetic changes to eliminate diabetes or Alzheimer's or reduce cancer risk or eliminate the application?
Would you not want to make those changes in their genes.
If you look at the future that kind of change is going to be increasingly possible.
The Human Genome Project started in 1990 and took 13 years.
It costs two billion dollars.
The next year of having finished, in 2004, I could do the same job for 20 million dollars in three or four months.
Today, you can get a full sequence of the three billion base pairs of the human genome to a cost near 20 and a week.
I'm not going to lack a lot for the human genome to make the human genome for $1,000 and getting closer and closer to everyone.
They come to those changes.
The same technology that has produced human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that are not only going to protect us from themselves, but they're going to induce immunity against other viruses.
Believe it or there's no experimental trial in course with the vaccine against growing in cells of a tobacco plant.
Can you imagine something good that comes out of the table?
That's reality today, and in the future it's going to be increasingly possible.
Imagine just two little changes.
Can they change the cells of their bodies, but what if they could change the cells of their described?
And if you could change the sperm and the flight, or change the newly fascinated volume, and give your children a better opportunity of a healthier life, eliminate the diabetes, to remove humanity, reduce the risk of cancer?
Who doesn't want any healthier children?
And then, that same analytical technology, that same engine engine that can produce changes to prevent diseases is going to allow us to also embrace supermarkets -- chemicals, a better memory.
Why don't you have the ingenuity of a Ken Jennix especially if you could increase it with the next generation of the Watson machine.
Why don't you have a faster contact muscle that allows us to run faster and more distance?
Why not live more time?
This is going to be terrible.
And when we are in conditions to pass this to the next generation and we can adopt the attributes that we want to have turned out the evolution of before in neurographics.
We're going to take a process that could normally take 100,000 years and we can compress it to 1,000 years and maybe happen within the next 100 years.
These are choices that their grandchildren, or the grandchildren of their grandchildren, are going to have them.
Are we going to use these options in the end of a better society, more successful, more conservative?
Or, are we going to choose selectively different attributes that we want to do for some of us, but not for others?
Are we going to build a society that is more boring and more universal or more very robust and more vertical?
This is the kind of question we're going to have to face.
And the most profound thing about all: Are we going to be able to develop wisdom and to inherit the wisdom necessary to make these decisions simply?
For good or evil, and before what I could think, these choices are going to depend on us.
Thank you.
Imagine a big explosion when you're at 900 feet tall.
Imagine an airplane full of smoke.
Imagine a engine making clear, yeah, yeah.
Of course, of course, of course, yeah, yeah. It sounds frightening.
Well, I had a unique seat that day -- I was sitting in the 12.
It was the only one who could talk to the flight breaks.
So I immediately looked at them, and they said, "There is no problem. We probably hit some bird shoes."
The pilot had already watched the plane, and we weren't so far.
You could see Manhattan.
Two minutes later, three things happened at the same time.
The pilot line up with the Hudson River.
That's usually not the route.
The engines came off.
Imagine being in an airplane and without noise.
And then he said three words.
The three more distorted words I've ever heard.
He said, "Please prepare for the impact."
I didn't have to talk more with the flight assistant.
I could see it in his eyes.
It was terror. Life was finished.
I want to share with you three things I learned about myself that day.
I learned that everything changes in a second.
We have this list of things to do before we die, these things that we want to do in life, and I thought about all the people I wanted to come in, and I didn't, all the fence I wanted to repair -- all the experiences I wanted to have, and I never had.
While I was thinking about that, I got a sentence, which is, "Come a bad window."
Because if the wine is ready, and the person is there, I'm going to open it.
I don't want to apply anything in life.
And that urgency, that purpose, really has changed my life.
The second thing I learned that day -- and this is as we released the George Washington, which was not a lot -- I thought, wow, I really feel a great way.
I've lived a good life.
In my humanity, and with my mistakes, I've tried to improve all I did.
But in my humanity, I also give rise to my ego.
And I regret the time I wasted in things that didn't matter with people who matter.
And I thought about my relationship with my wife, with my friends, with people.
And then, as measured in that, I decided to eliminate the negative energy of my life.
It's not perfect, but it's much better.
In two years, I haven't had a fight with my wife.
It feels wonderful.
I don't try to be right. I choose to be happy.
The third thing I learned -- and this is how your mental clock is going on, "15,000 14, 19."
You see water.
I'm saying, "Please fly.
I don't want this to break up in 20 pieces as you see in those papers.
And as we went down, I had the feeling of it, I would die not fear.
It's almost like we've been preparing for it all our life.
But it was very sad.
I didn't want to go. I love my life.
And that sadness was embedded in a single thought, which is, I just wish one thing.
I wish I could see my kids grow.
A month later, I was in an update of my daughter -- first grade, not a lot of artistic talent --  --  And I scream, crazy, like a little bit.
And for me, that was all the reason of being the world.
At that point, I understood those two points, that the only thing that matters in my life is to be a great father.
On the top of all, the only goal I have in life is to be a good father.
I became a miracle -- not dying that day.
And I became another gift, which was the possibility to look at the future and go back and live differently.
You are flying today, I challenge you to imagine that the same thing happens to you in your plane -- and please don't be like that -- but imagine, how do you change?
What they would do, they still hope to do because they think they're going to live forever, right?
How would they change their relationships and negative energy in them?
And most importantly, are the best parents who can be?
Thank you.
I've clearly been blessed in life with many amazing projects.
But the most great thing that I worked on was for this guy.
The guy is called TED.
TED was one of the most important graffiti freedoms in the 1980s.
One day he came to her house after running and said, "Dad, I feel a short in the legs.
And that was the beginning of ALS.
Now TED has a total paradigm.
You can only use your eyes.
His work influenced me.
I have a design business and animation, so obviously, graffiti is something that we admire and respect in the world of art.
So we decided that we were going to sponsor Tony TEDTMF, and their cause.
So I went and met with his brother and his father and I said, "We're going to give you this money.
What are you going to do with him?
And his brother said, "I just want to be able to talk to Tony again.
I just want to be able to communicate with him and that he's able to communicate with me."
And I said, "A second, isn't that -- I saw Stephen Hazara, is that all people with paralysis can communicate through those applications?
And he said, "No, unless you are very important, and you have a very good insurance you can't actually do it.
These devices are not affordable for people."
And I said, "Well, how do you communicate then?
Does anyone see the film, "The School and the March?
They communicate in that way -- they are running with the finger.
I said, "That's crazy. How can it be?
So I was presented with the only desire to deliver a check, and instead of that signed a little bit that had no idea how I was going to cover it.
I bought me with his brother and his father there at that particular time, "All right, this is the thing: Tony is going to talk, we're going to build a machine, and we're going to find a way to make his art again.
Because it's ridiculous.
So I talked about a couple of months later.
I met these guys called Ghana, "Grand Labert Lab," who have a technology that allows them to project a light on any surface and then, with a laser position, draw about that and record the negative space.
So they go around doing art facilities like this.
All the things that come up, they say, are part of a cycle of life.
First of all, they start with sexual organs, then with bad words, after the attacks to Bush and at the end, people start making art.
But there was always a cycle of life in his presentation.
And so the journey began.
And about two years later, about a year later, after a lot of organization and a lot to move the things on one side to another, we had made a couple of things.
One, we played the doors of insurance companies, and we got a machine so that TED could communicate, a machine like Stephen Hawking machine.
Which was great.
And seriously, it's the most fun. I call it YouTube because talking to the guy you get an email of him, and you say, "I don't deserve it. This guy is fantastic."
The other thing we did was bringing seven programmers from all over the world -- literally of all the world's corners -- to our house.
My wife, children and I, we moved to the garage of the back and these hackers and programmers and consumers took control of the house.
Many of our friends thought we did something completely stupid and that when we came back there would have taken out the squares of the walls and instead there would be graffiti place.
But for two weeks, we went to the Marine Marine Paulo, my son was part, my dog also, and we created this.
It's called Editorians "The "The East, and you can see the description of it.
They are a couple of cheap sunglasses that we buy in the sea step of Venice Beach, some copper wire and Honest Department and Radio Shakespeare.
We take a Ph camera, we open it, we put it on a LED light, and now there's a device that is free -- build it yourself. We published the free code, the software goes down in a free form.
And we create a device that has no limitation at all.
There's no insurance company that says, "No."
There's no hospital that can say, "No."
Any person with paralysis today has access to draw and communicate using just their eyes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. That was awesome.
So at the end of the two weeks, we went back to TED room.
I love this picture because this is the room of another person, and that's their room.
There was all this bullet and airport during the great opening.
And after more than a year of planning, two weeks of programming -- intense sessions at night, Tony came back to draw for the first time in seven years.
And this is a wonderful picture because this is the support system of his life and he's looking through the support system of his life.
We ran the bed so I could see.
And we put a project on a wall of the parking of the hospital.
And he went back to draw for the first time in front of his family and friends -- and I could imagine what was the feeling in the parking machine.
The funny thing was that we had to track the parking lot, so we felt like we were reading graffiti as well.
At the end of this, he sent us an email and this was what he said, "This was the first time I was drawing in seven years.
I felt like I'd been under the water, and someone finally came to rescue and would take me out there so I could breathe.
Isn't it wonderful?
In a way, that's our scream of war.
That's what keeps us in motion, developing it.
And we have a long way to go down with this.
It's a great device, but it's the equivalent of a magic screen.
Somebody with this artistic potential deserves much more.
So we're trying to figure out how to improve it and make it faster and robust.
Since then, we've had all kinds of recognition.
We've won many prizes.
Remember, it's free, none of us are making money with this.
Everything comes out of our own pockets.
The prizes were from the guy, "Oh, this is fantastic.
Armstrong tweet something about us, and then, in December, the Time magazine recognized us as one of the 50 best inventions of 2010, and it was really cool.
The best thing about this -- and this is what ends up closing the circle, is that in April this year at the MIT Center in the center of Los Angeles, there's going to be an exhibition called Arthur in the Streets."
And Art in the streets is going to have the best experiments of urban art, "January, Sheiler Faulin, China, all of them will be there.
TED is going to be in the show that's pretty impressive.
So basically this is my idea: if you see something that is not possible, make it possible.
None of what there is in this room was possible -- the stage, the computer, the Microsoft, nothing was possible at a certain moment.
Make it possible -- anything in this room.
I'm not a programmer, I never did anything with eye recognition technology, I just recognized something and I teamed up with wonderful people to make it happen.
And these are the questions that I want us all to do every day when we find something that we feel that you need to do. If it's not now, when, and if I'm not me, who?"
Thank you guys.
I've spent the last few years getting in very difficult situations and at the same time a very dangerous time.
I went to jail.
I worked on a coal mine. dangerous.
I filmed in zones of war -- difficult and dangerous.
And I spent 30 days eating just this -- fun at first, something difficult in the middle, very dangerous at the end.
In fact, in a lot of my career, I've been diving up in situations in horrible appearance with the only goal of trying to try to look at social issues in ways that are attractive, interesting, and, hopefully analyze them in a way that you see entertainment and accessible to the audience.
So when I knew that I would come here to make a TEDTalk about the world of brands and pathogenic I wanted to do something a little differently.
So some of you may have heard it, or not, a couple of weeks ago, I took an airplane in Edi.
I sent some messages on Facebook, some on Twitter, I offered the rights of the name of my TEDTalk in 2011.
What was the following was this: "The States Sure presents, my TEDTalk has no idea what it is and according to content could be explained in the face, especially if I put it in ridiculous to you or your company to do it.
But I said this, it's a very good media opportunity.
Do you know how many people look at these TEDTalks?
A lot.
It's a program in progress, by the way.
So even with that salvation knew that someone was going to buy the rights of the name.
If you had asked me a year ago, I would not have been able to tell you with certainty.
But in the new film that I'm working on, we looked at the world of marketing, of advertising.
And as I said before, I've been involved in horrible situations in the last few years, but nothing could prepare me, nothing could anticipate for something as difficult or as dangerous as entering the rooms with these guys.
You see, I had this idea for a movie.
Morgan Sleep: I want to make a film that tries to make the product of products and marketing and advertising, and that all the film is funded with pollution of products, marketing and advertising.
The movie is going to be called "The largest film ever selling."
What happens in "The largest movie ever selling is that everything from the top down to the bottom, in principle to end, has market images, all the time, from the position that comes before the title, the X brand X.
Now this brand, Camer Samais, the Star Screen.
These people are going to be assumed to the permission of perfection.
And so the film explores this whole idea. (Music Kasham: It's reduction." Is it what? MR: Is it reduced."
I'm a real weight. Man: I just say that. It was more for narratives.
It was "Perfect." forever."
But we're not just going to have the father sponsor in the title, but we're going to make sure we're going to get all the categories that we can in the film.
Maybe we sell a shoe and it becomes the most cool shoe you've ever used.
The most cool car you've been driving in "The largest film ever, the best piece of drink you have drink, correspondent of "The largest film ever selling."
Narrator Korea: The idea is then besides showing the brands as part of life, making them fund the film? (MR: And actually we show the film the film -- MS: And we actually show the whole process of how it works.
The goal of the full film is transparency.
You're going to see the whole process in this film.
That's the whole idea, the whole film -- of principle to end.
And I would love that Chris helps make it happen.
Robert Friedman: You know, it's funny because it's the first time I hear that -- it's the maximum respect for the audience.
Man: However, I don't know how it is going to be the people to that.
91," you have a perspective -- I don't know if "I get "a very negative -- but you know how it's going to represent? (MR: No idea. David Chinese) How much money does it do to do this?
MS: One million and a half million -- "DP: All right. John Kamen: I think it's going to be difficult with them, but certainly it's going to be worth a couple of big markets.
KB: Who knows, maybe for the moment that the movie comes out, we see a lot of joyful languages.
MS: What do you think it's going to be the answer?
Stuart Ruber: Most answers will be not."
MS: But will it be hard to sell it, by the film or to be I?
JK: Both things.
MS:  It means you're not very optimistic.
So help me? I need help.
MK: I can help.
MS: All right. MK: Okay. Awesome.
MK: We have to think about which markets.
MS: Yes. MK: That's the challenge: When you look at the people you have to deal with.
MK: We have some places where to go. (MR: Okay."
MS: I thought it was called the camera -- it meant we have a conversation out of microphone.
The camera comes up to me, "We don't want to know anything about your movie.
MS: And so it was, one by one, all these companies suddenly disappeared.
No one wanted to have anything to do with this film.
I was surprised.
They didn't want to know anything about this project.
And I was very impressed -- I thought the concept of advertising, was to introduce the product to as many people as possible, to get as many people to see it as possible.
Especially in the world today this intersection of new media and old media and the stage of the separate media is not the idea to count with that new worthy of attention that is going to take the message to the masses.
No, that's what I thought.
But the problem was, you see, my idea had a graduate mistake, and that error was this.
Actually, no, there was no mistake.
There was no mistake at all.
This would have been okay.
But the problem was what this image.
See, when you look for transparency images in Google --   this is one of the first images that comes in.
I like your way to robot, Sergey Brill. No.
This was the problem: transparency, free of simulation or deception -- easily detected or seen, easily understandable. That is characterized by the visible or access of information, especially in business practices.
You see, we heard a lot about transparency in these days.
Our politicians name it, the president of the name, even the CEOs of it.
But all of a sudden when it's trying to make something completely change.
But why? Well, transparency day fear --  like that weird bear that still keeps playing.
It's unpredictable.   Like this rare rural path.
And it's also very risky.
What else is that risk?
You will eat a whole cup of Coke White.
That's very risky.
When I started talking to companies and telling you that we wanted to tell this story and they said, "No, we want you to tell you a story.
We want you to tell you a story, but you tell us our story."
See, when I was a kid, and my father caught me in some lie -- and there he is looking at me as he used to do it, say, "Son, there are three sides in every story.
It's your story, it's my story, and it's the real story.
As you see, in this film we wanted to tell the real story.
But with just a company, an agency wanting to help me -- and that only because I knew John Bond and Richard Kiribati of many years -- I realized that I would have to go on my own, I would have to take up the intervention and go to companies myself with all my team.
So what I started looking at suddenly -- what I started to realize -- is that when you start talking to companies the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem.
MS: I have friends who make big movies, huge movies, giant and others who make small, independent movies, like mine.
And my friends who make Hollywood films, giant guys, say that the reason their movies are so successful is due to the associated brands that they have.
And then my friends who make independent movies say, "Well, how are we supposed to compete with these big, giant movies of Hollywood?
And the movie is called "The largest shell ever selling.
How are we going to see Bang specifically in the movie?
Every time I am to go out, every time I open my bottle, you'll see the Bandage Death.
At any time during an interview with somebody I can say, "Are you okay for this interview interest?
Are you ready? You see a little nervous.
I want to help you meet.
Maybe you should put a little bit of this before the interview."
And there I would offer one of these fabulous lamws.
Both Foundation Fluorescent as "Silence "The Parades are going to have their opportunity.
We're going to have so much for man as a woman, solid, blue, bank, whatever.
That's the general look.
Now I can answer your questions and give you a permanent look.
Karen Frank: We're a small brand.
And similar to the kind of smaller movies that you tell -- we are rather a rival brand.
So we don't have the budget that they have other brand.
So doing things like this, you know, remembering the people is the reason that we care about.
MS: What words would you use to describe Bang?
Bang is in white.
KF: That's a big question.
Woman: higher technology.
MS: Technology is not the way you want to describe something you put in the austination.
Man: We talked about something audacious, free.
I believe that "Free" is a great word that actually puts this category in positive versus "computer software and supermarket."
It keeps you cold.
How do you keep you free more time? With better frustration, more frustration, three times more dramatic.
Things like those who solve the benefits.
MS: And that's a multi-profit company.
What about me? What about a common kind?
I need to talk to the man on the street, to people like me, to the common Persists.
They have to talk about my brand.
MS: How do you define your mark?
Man: Mamma my mark?
I don't know.
I like the good clothing.
Woman: It will revive the '80s, passive pound unless it was a sleeping day.
MS: All right, what is Grazize Mark?
Grander: Something unique. (MR: Only one. Man: I guess the kind of gender, the style I have would be like a dark glamour.
I like dark colors, a lot of gray colors and things like that.
Usually I carry access as sunglasses, or I like the crystals and the same.
Woman: If Dan was a brand could be a classic conversation: Mars Bennin.
Man 2: The brand I am, would call it cause calor."
Woman 2: Partly hidden, partly in the part of the Boyah, I don't know.
Man 3: I'm the kind of male.
I sold toys for pets in the country and in the world.
So I guess that's my brand.
In my little sector, that's my brand.
Man 4: My brand is Federal because I get the market.
Man 5: Facebook failures.
Is that something?
Advanced: I'm a lawyer a lawyer.
Tom -- I'm Tom.
MS: Well, we can't all be a Tom brand, but I often rank in the intersection of dark glamour and causal flight.
I realized that I needed an expert.
I needed someone who could get into my head, someone who could help me understand what they call the "marketing personality."
And I found a company called Old Zapan in Pittsburgh.
They helped companies like Texas, Federa, Hamburg to discover that brand personality.
If you could do it for them, you could surely do it for me.
And also, I brought the pictures, right?
MS: Yeah. The first picture is a family photograph.
A: Tell me a little bit about how it relates to your thoughts and feelings your way to be.
MS: These people model my way to see the world.
A: Tell me about that world.
MS: That world? I think your world is the world that you live in, like the people around you, your friends, your family, the way you live your life, the work you do.
All of those things are originally originally, and they start in a place and in my case they come up and start in my family, in West Virginia.
A: What's the next one you want to talk about?
MS: The next one is "This was the best day of my life."
A: How does this relate to your thoughts, feelings and your way to be?
MS: It's like who I want to be me.
I like the different things.
I like weird things. I like weird things.
A: Tell me about "why" -- why does that serve us?
What's the male? What phase phase is you now?
Why is it important? What is the red representation?
Tell me a little bit about that.
A little more than you, which is not who you are.
What other metaphors have you had.
It doesn't have to be fear. What kind of Russian mountain are you?
MS: Yellow." (Audience: Thank you.) No, thank you.
A: Thank you for your patience, (MR: Great work." A, yes. (MR: Thank you very much. Very good.
MS: Yeah, I don't know what's going to come out of this.
There was a lot of madness.
Lind Galum," the first thing I saw was this idea that there are two different sides, but complicated, in your brand personality -- the March Magic brand is a conscious brand.
They get very good together.
And I think there's almost a paradox.
And I think some companies will only focus on one of their strong points or in the other instead of focusing on both.
A lot of companies tend -- and it's human nature -- to avoid the things that are not safe, they avoid fear -- those elements, and you actually give them a little bit of them and make them become positive for you, and it's nice to see that.
What other brands are you?
The first here is the classic here, Apple Apple.
And you can also see here, Who, Window, Minister Couptia and Jewish.
Now there are personal marks and conscious brands -- those things that have gone and came in, but a legal brand is something quite powerful.
MS: A self-assembly brand, what's your mark?
If someone asks you to describe your brand identity, your brand, what would it be?
Are you an aggregate asteroid? Are you somebody who makes blood flow.
Or are you rather a determined attribute?
A little bit more calm reserved, reserved, conservative?
And the amazing attributes are like being playful to be fresh as the Prize, contemporary contemporary or adventure, attract or bold as European Freedon, fast or good, profit, magical or mystic like Galapago.
Or are you rather deep than determined attribute?
Are you conscious as a 2007?
Are you self-assemble, traditional, protesters, protocell: Do you identify with Oregon?
Are you confident, stable, family, confident, safe, safe, controlled or wise or support, like the Dalai Lama or Audience?
In the course of this movie we had over 500 companies, ancient and determined, who said, "No, they didn't want to be part of this project.
They didn't want to have anything to do with this movie, mainly because they wouldn't have control, they wouldn't have control about the final product.
They allowed us to tell the story of the neuroscience, and we get to tell the story in this movie of how they now use magnetic resonance to identify the centers of desire in the brain as much for commercial marketing as for movies.
We went to San Paul where they've banned the advertising to free air.
All over the city over the last five years, there are no valleys, no cards, no fly, nothing.
And we went to school districts where companies are doing road in schools with liquid problems in America.
The amazing thing to me is that the projects in which I've had the biggest answer or the most successful is those in which I've interacted with things directly.
And that's what these markers did.
They took up the inner, they took their agencies, and they said, maybe these agencies don't have my best interest in mind.
I'm going to deal directly with the artist.
I'm going to work with him to create something different, something that will make people think about the way that we look at the world.
And how have you gone? Did you have success?
Well, since the movie is stressed in the Sunday Festival -- let's take a look.
According to Burrows, the movie will stand in January, and since then -- and this is not all -- we've had 900 million impressions in the media for this film.
This covered just a couple of two and a half weeks.
That's just online -- no press, no TV.
The movie is still not distributed yet.
It's still not online. It's not in shark.
It's not even presented in other countries yet.
Ultimately, this film has already begun winning momentum.
And it's not wrong because almost all the agencies that we talked about was advised to their customers not to be part.
I've always believed that if you take risks, if you take risks, that in those risks there are opportunities.
I think when you take people out of that, they're pushing them into failure.
I think when you train their employees in the risk of risk it's preparing all its company to lack of rewards.
I feel that what has to happen to move forward is that we need to encourage people to risk.
We have to encourage people to have no fear of the opportunities that they can use them.
Ultimately, move forward, I think we have to give it place to fear.
We have to put that bear in a cage.
We open the fear. We embrace risk.
From one car at a time, we have to embrace risk.
And ultimately, we have to go to transparency.
Now more than ever a little bit of honesty is going to take a long way.
And I said this, with honesty and transparency, all my talk "We "could "The Transparency has been presented by my good friends of ECXA who for 17,000 bought the rights of the name in Edi.
EM: turning big data into great opportunities for companies around the world.
ECX presented "The Transparency.
Thank you very much.
June Cohen: So, Mongolia, on the name of transparency, which happened exactly with those 17th?
MS: It's an exceptional question.
In my pocket I have a name of the name of the TED matrix organization, the Speechter Foundation, a cooking for 7,000 to be applied to my TED care for the next year.
The idea behind the Stanford computer worm is actually very simple.
We don't want Iran to get the nuclear bomb.
Their biggest asset to develop nuclear weapons is the University plant in National.
The gray boxes that you see are systems of control in real time.
If we managed to compromise these systems that control speed and valves -- we can cause a lot of problems with the self-assembly.
The gray boxes don't use Windows software -- completely different technology.
But if we managed to put an effective virus from Windows in a portable computer used by an engineer to confirm this gray box, then we are ready.
This is the plan behind Steven.
We started with a Windows.
The oxygen income the gray box, damage the feature, and the Iranian nuclear program is demonstrated.
It's easy, huh?
I want to tell you how we discovered this.
When we started researching about Steven six months ago, the purpose was completely unknown known.
The only thing you knew is that it's very, very complex in the Western part of Windows: the installation used multiple valuable vulnerability.
It seemed to want to do something with these gray boxes, these grades of control.
That called us the attention, and we started an experiment where we infect our environment with Stewart, and we saw what was going on with this.
So they went very strange things.
Steven was behaving as a laboratory rat that he didn't like our bread," he waves, but he didn't want to eat.
It had no sense for me.
And after experimenting with different cheese flavors -- I realized, and I thought, "This is a directed attack.
It's completely slide."
The installation is actively looking at the gray box if you find a specific configuration, and even if the program that's trying to infect is effectively working in that place.
You don't do anything.
So that called my attention, and we started working on this almost 24 hours a day, because I thought, "We don't know what the goal is.
It might be, say, for example, an American energy plant, or a chemical plant in Germany.
You'd better discover the goal soon.
And so we extracted and climbed the attack code, and we found that it was structure in two digital bombs -- a small and a big.
We also saw that they were very deeply armed by people who obviously had all the internal information.
They knew all the points that I would attack.
They probably even know how much the operator is.
So you know everything.
And if you've heard that Steven installing is complex and high technology, let me tell you, the burden is very complex.
It's very above all we've seen before.
Here you see a sample of this attack code.
We're talking about about 15,000 lines of code.
It looks pretty much like the old sample language.
I want to tell you how we could find this code.
What we were looking for at the beginning were called the systems of the system, because we know what they do.
Then we looked for temperature and data structures and we tried to relate to the real world, with potential objective potential of the real world.
We need the theories about dinosaurs that we can approve or destroy.
To get to theories about goals, we remember that it's definitely a violent savings, it must be a valuable white, and it's safe in Iran, because it's where most infections have been represented.
You don't find several thousand targets in that area.
It basically boils down to the nuclear energy plant of Bush and the National embassing plant.
So I said to my assistant, "Tear a list of all experts in self-assembly and power plants between our clients."
I called them and held them into an effort for taking their experience with what we found in code and data.
And it worked pretty well.
So we were able to associate the little digital oxygen with the control of the robot.
The robot is that mobile part of the forecast, that black object that you see.
If you manage the speed of this robot, you certainly can break it and even make your farmer explode.
What we also saw is that the goal of the attack was to make it slow and download in an obvious effort to go back to the nest maintenance engineers, so they couldn't solve this quickly.
We tried to figure out the digital digital eye looking very close to the data and their structures.
So, for example, number 145 is going to be in that code, you can't get obvious.
I started investigating scientific literature about how these centers are built in National and found that they're structures in what's called a catch, and every waterfall contains 165 centers.
That had sense, there was a coincidence.
And it became better yet.
These fragments in Iran are divided in 15 parts called stages.
And guess what we found in the attack code code?
A almost identical structure.
So again, that was a good coincidence.
This gave us a lot of confidence to understand what we had between hands.
So that there is no mainstream: it wasn't like this.
The results have been made after several weeks of hard work.
We usually ended up in color and we had to go back again.
Yet, we discovered that both digital eyes were pointing to one and same goal, but from different angles.
The little girl is taking a waterfall and making the robots turn up and religion and the big eye communicates with six cars and manipulating tubes.
In size, we're very confident that we've determined what the disability is.
It's National, and it's just National.
We should not worry that other goals are achieved by Stewart.
Here I show you some very interesting things that we saw, really struck me.
There's the gray box, and then you see the self-assembly on it.
What this thing does is to intercept the input values of sensors, for example, from pressure sensors and vibration sensors and provide legitimate code, which is still executed during the attack, with false input data.
And believe it or not, these fake input data are pushed by Stewart.
It's like in the Hollywood movies where, during the theft, the security camera feeds a private video.
Is it great one?
The idea here is obviously not just going to erase the operators in the control room.
It's really much more dangerous and aggressive.
The idea is to bring a digital security system.
We need digital security systems where a human operator could not act fast.
For example, in an energy plant, when the great steam of steam is happening -- you have to open up a military shock in a milliseconds.
Obviously, this can't do a human operation.
That's where we need digital security systems.
And when they're committed to, then they can pass bad things.
The plant can explode.
And no operations or the security system will notice it.
That scares that.
But it can be worse.
What I'm going to say is very important.
Think about this. This attack is genetic.
It has nothing to see, specifically with centrality, with uranium embassing.
It could also work as well, for example, in an energy plant, or in an automotive factory.
It's genetic.
And you don't have -- like a startup that is going to disseminate this burden with a USB key, as we saw in the case of Steven.
You could also use conventional technology of worms to disseminate it.
You can design it as possible.
And if you do that, what you end up with is a censor of mass destruction.
That's the consequence we need to face.
Unfortunately, the largest number of targets for such attacks is not in the Middle East.
It's in the United States and Japan.
All the green areas are spaces with large numbers of goals.
We have to face the consequences and better than we start to prepare now.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I have a question.
Ralopation, has been done in many sides that people assume that the Mosses is the main entities behind this.
What's your opinion?
Ralph London: Okay, really want to hear this?
Yeah. Okay.
My view is that the Mosseps is involved, but the engine is not Israel.
The engine behind this is cyber survival.
There is one single single one, and that's the United States, fortunately, fortunately, fortunately, enough.
Because otherwise our problems would be even larger.
CA: Thank you for searching. Thank you, Raloi.
I want you to imagine a robot that you can take and give you some surface skills, or another one that makes your wheelchair users get up and go back and walk.
In Berkeley Bionex? We call these robots, exhibitions.
They're nothing different from something that gets put in the morning, gives you a great force -- that it also increases its speed, and it helps you, for example, to drive the balance.
It's actually the real integration of the man and the machine.
But not just that -- you can integrate it and connect it with the universe and with other external entrepreneurs.
This is not a real idea.
To show you now what we're working on, we start talking about the American soldier that, in average, should take on its own back a 45-year-old load of charge, and it's getting rid of it even more team.
Obviously, this leads to some important complications -- injuries in the back, in 30 percent of the soldiers -- with chronic damage.
We decided to consider this challenge and create an exoskeleton that could help drive the issue.
Let me introduce the HIV/AIDS -- or Portuge Human Carolinas Carol.
Soldier: With the HIV/AIDS exoskeleton I can give you 90 pounds by variable terrain for many hours.
Their flexible design, allows you to put into class and execute movements with great animation.
I perceive what I want to do, or where I want to go, and then I increase my strength and my resistance.
Editer Bendon: We're ready, with our industrial partner to produce this device, this new exoskeleton this year.
I mean, it's a reality.
So now we go back to the wheelchair users of wheelchair, about what I feel particularly passionate about.
There are 68 million people in the wheelchair around the world.
Like one percent of the total population.
And this is a really conservative calculation here.
We talk about something that is often happening, very young people, with damage in the cerebral column that when they start their life -- at the age of 20, 30 or 40 -- collide against a wall, and the wheelchair turns out to be their only option.
We also talk about the population that makes it very quickly.
Their only choice, many times -- for a brain injury or some other complications -- is the wheelchair of wheels.
And this has been like this for the last 500 years, from their successful emergence as I have to recognize.
So we decided to start to write a new chapter about mobility.
Let me introduce you the ELG that is using Amanda Bob who 19 years ago had a injury in the vertical column, and as a result couldn't go back for 19 years, so far.
Amanda Bob," thank you.
EB: Amanda is using our Ellawhorshid, which I mentioned.
It has a few sensors.
They're completely not invasive in the mountains that send signals to the board computer, here in the back.
There are also a few batteries that give the motors in the hip.
AB: I was 24 on the top of my life when I was a strange jump in the air, skiing it down in the air.
In a fraction of a second, I lost all feeling and all the brilliant balls down.
Shortly later, a doctor walked into my room in the hospital, and he said, "Lamama, you'll never walk again.
That's 19 years ago.
And so I stole up to the last fish of hope of my being.
The adaptation technology since then, has allowed me to learn how to turn out costs on the back, climbing rocks and even riding in hand bicycle.
But they haven't invented anything that allows me to walk, so far.
Thank you.
EB: As you can see, we have the technology, we have the platforms to sit and talk to you.
It's in our hands, and we have all the potential here to change the lives to future generations -- not just soldiers, but to Amanda and all the users of wheelchair of wheelchair to all.
AB: Thank you.
I just came back from a community that has the secret of human survival.
It's a place where women have the battery, practice sex to say hello, and the game is the order of the day, where the fun is serious.
And no, it's not the festival of the Middle Arduino or San Francisco.
Ladies and gentlemen, you know their cousins.
This is the world of the wild Bonobo seals of Congo.
Bonobos are, along with chimpanzees, their closest living relatives in the books.
That means we all share a common ancestor, an evolutionary grandmother, that lived about six million years ago.
Now, chimpanzees are known by their aggression.
But unfortunately, we've done too much in this aspect in our narratives of human evolution.
But the bonobos show us the other side of the coin.
Whereas chimpanzees are dominated by big guys, terrifying people, Bonobos society is in charge of females with power.
These guys have created something special -- because this leads to a very tolerant society where death violence hasn't yet been seen.
But unfortunately, bonobos are the least understood of the big apes of things.
They live in the depths of the Congolese rainforest, and it's been very difficult to study them.
The Congo is a paradox -- a land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty, but also the heart of the tsunami itself -- stage of a violent conflict that has been protected for decades and caused almost as many deaths as the First World War.
It's not surprising that this destruction also puts the survival of the Bonobo.
The hunting meat of hunting and deforestation makes you can't fill a stadium with the bonobos that stay in the world, and honestly, we're not sure of it.
However, in this land of violence and chaos, you can hear the hidden laughter by measuring the trees.
Who are these primes?
We know them as the apes of the love, not war, because they have fresh sex, promise and bisexual to manage conflict and solve social problems.
I'm not saying that this is the solution to all the problems of humanity because the life of the Bonobo is more than the Kamen Sun.
Booms, like humans, love playing throughout their lifetime.
Play isn't just a game of children.
For us and for them, the game is fundamental to establish links and promote tolerance.
We learn how to trust, and we learn the rules of play.
Play increases creativity and resilience, and it has to do with the generation of diversity -- diversity of interactions, behavior diversity diversity of connections.
And when you look at the bank game, you see the evolutionary roots of laughter, dance and human ritual.
The game is the glue that binds us.
I don't know how you play you, but I want to show you a couple of unique videos taken from the wild medium.
First, it's a ball of ball bank -- and I don't talk about football and foreign.
Here we have a female and a young male in the middle of a perspective.
Look at what she is doing.
It could be the evolutionary origin of the phrase, "The Ballet has been broken.
Only I think in this case he loves him, right?
Yeah.
So sexual game is common as well as humans.
And this video is really interesting because it shows -- this video is really interesting because it shows the invention of bringing unusual elements into play -- like the testimonizations, and also how play requires trust and promotes trust -- and at the same time it's the most fun.
But the game is public.
The game is policy, it can adopt a lot of forms, some of which are more quiet and imaginative -- maybe the place where the awe is supported.
And I want you to see -- this is Future, a young female who is playing with water.
I think that we sometimes play, and we explore the limits of our inner worlds and outside.
And it's that playful curiosity that drives us to explore, to interact and then the unexpected connections that we form are the real seed of creativity.
These are just small samples of understanding that Bonobos give us our past and present.
But they also have a secret for our future, a future where we have to adapt to a more difficult world with greater creativity and greater cooperation.
The secret is that play is the key to these capabilities.
In other words, the game is our adaptation food.
To adapt to a world that changes we have to play.
But will we leverage our game ability?
The game is not fruit.
Play is essential.
For Bonobo and humans alike, life is not just cruel and destroyed.
When it looks like the least appropriate play, it can be the moments when it's the most urgent thing.
So, primates, we accept this gift of evolution and play together as we rediscovered creativity, friendship and wonder.
Thank you.
In New York I'm responsible for developing a nonprofit organization called Robin Howard.
When I'm not fighting poverty, I combat fire as a captain of captain in a body of voluntary firemen.
And in our city, where volunteers compare to a highly skilled staff you have to get to the fire site very soon to get into action.
I remember my first fire.
I was the second volunteer in the site, so I had a pretty high probability to go.
But there was still a career to foot against the other volunteers to get to the captain and figure out what our task was.
When I found the captain -- I was frustrated in a conversation with the property that was certainly able to catch one of the worst days of his life.
We were at a full night, she was standing outside in the rain, under a fight, on a pain, discovery, while his house was in fire.
The other volunteer I had just arrived at before I was -- "Let's call him Leonardo Luther --  -- came first to the captain and he asked him to go and save the dog of the house.
The dog. I was so color."
There I was a lawyer or a gesture of money that, during the rest of his life, I would have to tell the people who entered a building building to save a live living just because they won me for five seconds.
Well, I was the next one.
The captain made me an administrator.
He said, "Well, I need to do between the house.
I need to go up, go through the fire, and bring this woman a couple of shoes."
I swear it.
It was not exactly what I expected but I went -- I got up the stairs, at the end of the hallway -- went to the real firemen that I was at the time they had ended up taking off the fire and went into the main room for a couple of shoes.
I know what you're thinking, but I'm not a hero.
I took my payload back through the ladder where I met my NMS and the precious dog on the main door.
We took out of the house for the home owner where, as it was to wait, his testosterone received much more attention than mine.
A few weeks later, the department received a letter of the house to thank you for the brave effort demonstrated to save your house.
The kindness that she looked at the other was that someone had reached him even a couple of shoes.
So much in my voice in Robin Howard as in my voice as a voluntary pump I'm a vote of act of generosity and kindness in a monumental scale, but also of very large-scale acts and courage.
And you know what I've learned?
Everything has its importance.
So when I look at this room to people who have come in, or they are going to be able to get -- remarkable levels of success, I'd like to remind you this: Don't wait.
They don't wait for the first million to make the difference in somebody's lives.
If you have something to do, you get it now.
They serve food in a comment, clean a park of the neighborhood.
They're mentors.
Not every day we're going to have the opportunity to save someone's lives, but every day we're going to influence somebody's lives.
So go into the game -- save the shoes.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Mark, Mark comes back.
Mark Bees" -- Thank you.
This may seem strange, but I'm a great admiration of the concrete block.
The first concrete blocks were made in 1868 with a very simple idea: cement modules of a fixed measure that fit each other.
Very quickly, these became the most used construction unit in the world.
They have allowed us to build bigger things than us, like buildings or bridges, a brick at a time.
Essentially, these blocks have become the pillars of our time.
Almost a hundred years later, in 1947, LEDs came up with this.
It was called automatic assembly library.
And in a few years, LED bricks.
It's estimated that they've made more than 400 billion or 75 bricks per person on the planet.
You don't have to be engineer to build beautiful bridges or buildings or houses.
LED made it accessible.
LED just adopted the concrete block, the favorite in the world, and turned it into a fundamental piece of our imagination.
Meanwhile, exactly that same year, in the Bell labs, the next revolution was about to announce them, the new building block.
The transistor was a small unit of plastic that would take us from a world of aesthetic brick liberals about others to a world where everything was interactive.
Just like the concrete block, the transistor allows you to create a much bigger and more complex circuit, a brick at a time.
But there's a main difference -- the transistor was just for experts.
I personally don't accept it, that building blocks of our time are reserved to experts, so I decided to change it.
Eight years ago, when I was at the Media Lab, I started exploring the idea of taking the power of engineers to the hands of artists and designers.
A few years ago, I started developing Lettions.
I'm going to show you how they work.
Little Litters are electronic modules each with a specific function.
They're predicted to be light, sound, engines and sensors.
And the best of all is that they're joined by images.
So you can't put it wrong.
Liberators have a color code.
The green is the room, the blue is the stream, the pink is the input and the orange color is the algae.
So you just have to assemble a blue with one green and very quickly -- you can start making bigger circuits.
A blue with one green produce light.
We can put a button in the middle and so we have a rectangle.
If we change the button for a pulse of pulse, which is here, and now we have an interface light.
We added this guy to create more impact and we have a noise machine.
I'm going to stop this.
So beyond simple play, Litterstants are actually very powerful.
Instead of having to program and connect and soldier, Litterstell allows us to program using very simple intuitive gestures.
To make it paralyzed faster or slower, it just takes this button that makes the pulse faster or slower.
The idea behind Lettype is that it's a growing collection.
We want all of the interactions in the world to be reduced to liberals to use.
Light, sound, solar panels, engines -- everything must be accessible.
We've given the kids to see them playing with them.
And it's been an incredible experience.
The best is how they start to understand the electronics of every day that don't learn in schools.
For example, how a light light works, or why the door of an elevator gets open, or how an iPod responds to the touch.
We've also led to design schools.
So for example, designers without experience in electronics start playing with Lettype as a material.
Here you can see, with paper bottles and film, we have George creating.
(Music sounds)  A few weeks ago, we took Lettions to the Rhode Island School designers who don't have any experience in engineering, just in cardboard, wood and paper and said, do something.
Here's an example of a project that you've done, a convenience of convenience active by movement.
But wait, here comes my favorite project.
It's a landmine made of plastic that is afraid of darkness.
For these not engineers, Letturnian became another material, electronics became another material.
And we want this material to be the scope of everyone.
So Lettype has open source.
You can visit the website, download all the design files and manufacture them.
We want to encourage a world of creators and inventors and collaborators because this world we live in, this interactive world, is ours.
So ahead and invent it.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you today about unexpected discoveries.
I work in the solar technology industry.
And my little company seeks to engage with the environment.
They were distributed collaboration.
This is a little video of what we do.
Mmm. Wait a moment.
You can sleep a little bit in charge.
We can be able to better leave the video on one side.
No.
This is not.
All right.
Solar technology is ...
Oh, I'm afraid of time?
All right. Thank you very much.
A couple of years ago I launched an initiative to recruit the best designers and techniques to take a year and work in an environment that represents almost everything that they are supposed to stop, we asked them to work in the government.
The initiative was called Chinese for America and would be like a Peace Peace People.
We selected some members every year and we put them to work with the municipalities.
Instead of sending them to the Third World we send them to the global global wildlife.
They made great applications -- they worked with the municipal employees.
Their task is to show the possibilities of today's technology.
You know A.
A the city of Boston.
So here it appears as if you look for a quote, but what you really look for is that someone clean it when you get caught by the snow because you know that it's not very good at taking fires when it's covered by a meter of snow.
How did it come to ask for help in this similar way?
Last year in Boston we had a team of Chinese members for America.
They were there in February, and at that time I was doing a lot last year.
They realized that the city never clean these hydrogens.
But one of the members named Erik Michellergers noticed something else, that citizens cleaned up with the sidewalks right in front of them.
So it did like any good programmer, developed an app.
It's a nice application where you can adopt a hunger.
You accept to clean it up.
When you do that, you put a name, in this case you put it.
If you don't do it, somebody can steal you.
I mean, it has a playful component.
It's a modest application.
Maybe it's the smallest of the 21 partners programmed last year.
But it does something that no other government technology does.
And it becomes viral form.
One responsible of the Hollywood City systems when you see this application realized that I could use it, not for snow, but so that citizens adopted the tsunami services.
It's very important that these tsunami sharks work, but people steal the batteries.
So they ask citizens to control them.
And then Seattle decided to use it to make citizens wake up the catalogues that are showing up.
And Chicago just launched it to get people to record to clean sidewalks when I snow.
So now we know nine cities that plan to use it.
And this has been spread without fractions, in organic and natural ways.
If you know a little bit of government technology you'll know that this doesn't normally happen.
The software acquisition usually takes a couple of years.
Last year in Boston we had a team working on a project that took three people for two and a half months.
It was a tool for parents to choose the best public school for their children.
Then they told us that having done by the normal channels would have taken at least two years and cost about two million dollars.
And that's nothing.
Now there's a project in the judicial power of California that until the moment has cost two billion dollars and doesn't work.
And there are projects like this in every level of government.
So an application that is programmed in a couple of days, and it becomes viral shape is a kind of rise of advantage to the institution of government.
It suggests the best way to work, not like the private companies, like a lot of people think it should be.
Not as a technological company, but rather like the Internet itself.
I mean, without restrictions, in open and generous.
And that's important.
But the most important thing about this app is that it represents how to address the question of the government that has new generation, not as a problem of an unconscious institution but as a collective action problem.
And that's very good because it turns out that we are very good for collective action with digital technology.
And there's a very large community of people who are building the tools for us to work together with efficacy.
And it's not only Chinese for America but there are hundreds of people around the country that contribute to civic applications every day in their own communities.
They haven't been given by the government.
They feel a great frustration to that, but they don't complain it, they fix it.
And these people know something that we've lost from sight.
And it is that if we leave the feelings about politics, the row in the DNA, and all those other things that get us crazy, the government is essentially in the words of Tim Olympic: "What we do together because we can't only can."
Now, a lot of people have abandoned government.
If you're one of those people, I would ask you to recognize it, because things are changing.
Politics doesn't change the government.
And because the government at the last instance of us -- remember that from us, the people? The way to think about it will affect the way we produce change.
I didn't know a lot about government when I started with this.
And as a lot of people thought that government is to choose people to occupy charges.
Well, after two years I've come to the conclusion that the government is, mostly of suggestion.
This is the telephone care center of services and information.
It's the place that comes up with called 31 in the U.S.
Scott took this call.
Indeed "Kaid in the official knowledge.
I didn't find anything. It started with animal control.
And he finally said, "Hey, you can open the doors of the house, put a good music and see if it's going?
And it worked. So it worked.
But that wasn't the end of the sugar.
Boston doesn't have a call center.
It has an app and web and mobile, called Controllers Connecticut.
We don't program that application.
It was the work of very smart people in the Office of New urban Medical Britain.
And one day, this was really coming up with this question: "Kansary in my garbage cube -- I don't know if it's dead.
How do I do that?
The City Center dynamic is different.
Scott was talking to you.
In Conference Connecticut everything is public, so everybody can see this.
In this case, he saw it a neighbor.
The next report said, "I approached the place, I found the garbage cube behind the house.
Karia? Yes. alive? Yes. Yes.
I went home. I went home.
Good evening, sweet sweet."
Quite simple.
This is great. It's the conflict of the digital and the physics.
And it's also a great example of the income income to distributed voluntary collaboration.
But it's also a great example of government as a platform.
And here I don't necessarily mean the technological definition of platform.
I talk about a platform for people to get together and help others.
So a citizen helped another one, but here the government had a key role here.
I connected two people.
And it could have connected to the government services of being necessary but the neighbor is a better alternative and cheaper than government services.
When a neighbor helps another, we provide communities.
If we call animal control, it costs a lot of money.
One important thing that we have to think about government is that it's not the same thing as politics.
A lot of people understand it, but you think you're the input of the other.
That our entry to the government system is the vote.
How many times have you chosen a political leader, sometimes we spend a lot of energy to choose a new political leader and then hope that the government reflects our values and satisfied our needs, but then we don't see changes.
That's because the government is like an immense ocean and politics is the surface layer of 15 feet.
Below is what we call burial.
And we say that word with a lot of waste.
But it is that waste that keeps that that really belongs to us that we fund as something that operates in our back, that other thing, and in consequence we're losing power.
People believe that politics is sexy.
If we want this institution to work, we will have to make the bureaucracy sexy.
Because it's where the real government works.
We have to collaborate with the government machinery.
That's the Muslim movement.
Have you seen them?
It's a group of concerned citizens that have written a very detailed report of 325 pages in response to the request of the financial reform project on the financial reform.
That's not political activism -- it's bureaucratic activist.
And for those of us who have resisted to the government, it's time we ask us what world we want to leave our children.
You have to see the huge challenges that they'll have to face.
Do you really think we're going to get where we have to go to where we have to go to the institution that can act in behalf of all?
We can't press government, we need to be more effective.
The good news is that with technology is possible to rethink the government function so that it can expand to civil society.
There's a generation that grew up with the Internet, and you know that it's not so hard to act constantly, you just have to articulate systems in the right way.
The average age of age of our members is 28 years old, so I am a bigger generation than many of them.
This is a generation that has grown up taking the word and giving that almost for granted.
They're not giving that battle that we all face about who's going to talk about who they're going to talk about.
They can express their opinions in any channel at the same time, and they do.
So when you face the problem of the government you don't care much to hear your voices.
They're using hands.
They put hands to the work to program applications that make the government better.
And those applications allow us to use our hands to improve our communities.
It can be cleaning a hydrant together, taking up weeds -- empty a garbage cube that has a shark inside.
Of course, we could always have cleaned those hydrogen and a lot of people do.
But these applications are as digital reminder that we're not just consumers, not only are we consumers of government that we pay taxes, and we get services.
We're more than that: we're citizens.
And we're not going to fix the government until we don't fix the citizens.
So I want to ask all the present, when it comes to the important things that we have to do together, all together, will we be a volume of voices, or will we also be a hand of hands?
Thank you.
This is for me a real honor.
I've spent most of the time in jails and prisons and death range.
I've spent most of my life in marginalized communities, projects and places where there's a lot of despair.
And being here at TED watching and hearing these systems has given me a lot of energy.
One of the things I've noticed in this short time, is that TED has identity.
And the things that are saying here are impact around the world.
In occasion, if something comes from TED, it makes a sense and a force that would have no other way.
I say this because I think identity is truly important.
We've seen fantastic presentations.
And I think we've learned that the words of a teacher can make a lot of sense, but if you teach it to feel, you can have a special meaning.
A doctor can do good things, and it's a cartoonist, it can make a lot more.
So I want to talk about the power of identity.
I didn't really learn this in the practice, my job.
I learned it from my grandmother.
I grew up in a traditional house of an African-American family dominated by a marketing, which was my grandmother.
It was hard, it was strong, it had power.
It was the last word in the family in the family.
She started a lot of the decisions in our home.
It was a daughter of people who had been slaves.
His parents were born in slavery in Virginia about 1840.
She was born about the 1880s and his experience with slavery as he saw the world.
She was hard, but she was also angry.
When I was small and looked at her, she came up with me and gave me a good hug for me.
I was so strong that I could barely breathe, and then I was survived.
One or two hours later, I went back to look at it, came up and said, Brian, still feel my archite?
And if I said no, I was grabbed again, and if I said yes, I was left in peace.
He had this human quality that he would always want to be close to her.
The only problem is that I had 10 children.
My mother was the least of 10.
In occasion, when I was going to spend a time with her, it wasn't easy to capture his time and his attention.
My cousins were running everywhere.
I remember when I was eight or nine years old, I woke up a morning, I went to the room and they were running all my cousins.
My grandmother was on the other side of the room and looked at me very much.
At the beginning, I thought it was a game.
And so he looked at it and smiled, but she was very serious.
After 15 or 20 minutes, she got up, through the room, he took me out of my hand and said, "You see Brazil. We will convert them."
I remember this as if it was yesterday.
I'll never forget it.
And he took me out and said, Brian, I'll tell you something, but you can't tell anyone.
I said, "Okay, Mama! Mam."
She said, "Now make sure you're not. I said, "Sure."
Then I sat down, he looked at me and said, "I want you to know I've been looking at you."
And he said, "I think you're special.
He said, "I think you can do what you want.
I'll never forget it.
Then he said, "I just want you to promised me three things, Brian."
I said, "Hey, Mama! Mam."
And he said, "The first thing I want you to promise me is you would always want your mother."
He said, "She is my daughter, and you have to promise you to always be careful."
As I would love my mom, I said, "Yes, Mama, so I'll do."
Then he said, "The second thing I want you to promise me is that you will always do the right thing even though the right thing is the difficulty."
I thought about it, and I said, "Yes, Mam.
Then finally he said, "The third thing I want you to promise me is that you will never drink alcohol.
I was nine years old, and I said, "Yes, Mama, so I'll do."
I grew up in the field, in rural south. I have a brother a year older and a sister a year.
When I was 14 or 15, one day my brother came home with a six beers painting, I don't know where the shortcuts did, I grabbed my sister and I went to the forest.
We just got to do the crazy.
He took a beer surface, offered my sister, she took a little bit and offered me to me.
I said, "No, no, no. It's okay. You go, but I'm not going to take beer.
My brother said, "Come on. Today I do it. And you always do the same thing as us.
I already took something, your sister as well.
I said, "No. I wouldn't feel good. You can follow.
Then my brother looked at me.
And he said, "What happens? Take a close bar."
And I took the look with strength and said, "Oh, not you're going to be thinking about the conversation with Mama."
I said, "But what are you talking about?
He said, "Mame tells all the grandchildren who are special.
I was going away.
I have to admit something to you.
I'll tell you something that I probably shouldn't say.
I know that this will be spreading away.
But I'm 52 years old, and I can admit that I've never taken a drop of alcohol.
I don't say this thinking that it's a virtue, I say it for the power that identity is.
When we create the right type of identity, we say things to others who really don't look like.
We can't get them to do things that don't think can be able to do.
I think my grandmother naturally believed that all of his grandchildren were special.
My grandfather had been prisoners during the bank.
My uncle died of age-related diseases.
And these were the things that I was, according to it, we had to get up.
Now, try to talk about our criminal justice system.
This country is today very different than it was 40 years ago.
In 1973, there were 300,000 prisoners.
Today there are 2.3 million.
In America, we have the largest incarceration rate in the world.
We have seven million people in conventional freedom.
And this massive incarceration, in my opinion, has fundamentally changed our world.
In poor communities, or black communities, you find so much destiny, so much despair.
One from three black black between 18 and 30 is in prison or conditional freedom.
In urban communities all over the country, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Washington, 500 to 60 to 60 to 60 percent of all young colors are in jail, or conventional freedom.
Our system is not just distorted in front of race, it's also about poverty.
In this country we have a judicial system that is much better if you're rich and guilty that if you're poor and innocent.
It's not culture, but wealth is worth consistency.
And we seem very quiet.
The politics of fear and force makes us believe that these are not problems.
We're deployed.
It seems interesting.
We're looking at our work some very curious development.
In my state, in Alabama, as well as other states, they provide you of rights forever, if you have a criminal condition.
Right now in Alabama, 34 percent of the black male population has definitely lost the right to the vote.
And if we project it over the next 10 years, the level of rights loss will be as elevated as it was before they passed the law of the right to the vote.
We have this amazing silence.
I represent children.
Many of my customers are very young.
America is the only country in the world where it felt to 13-year-old children to die in prison.
We have in this prison country for kids, no possibility to go out before.
Right now we're in a process of some licenses.
The only country in the world.
It represents people on death row, right?
This issue of death penalty is interesting.
In some sense, have you taught us to think that the final question is, people deserve dying by commissioned crimes?
A very sensitive question.
But it can be thought about how we're in our identity.
There's another way to look at it, it's not about deciding whether people deserve to die for the crimes, but if we deserve to kill.
This is interesting.
The death penalty in America is defined by error.
In every nine extra people, it's identified one that is innocent and liberated from the corridor of death.
A mistake, amazing. An innocent in nine.
This is interesting.
In aviation it wouldn't ever be allowed to pilot airplanes if in every nine they would say, you would be stressed.
But somehow we get rid of the problem.
It's not our problem.
It's not our charge.
It's not our fight.
I talk a lot about these things.
I talk about race and this issue of if we deserve to kill it.
It's interesting that in my classes with students about African-American history, I talk about slavery.
I talk to you about terrorism, the time it started at the end of the reconstruction and that lasted to World War II.
We don't really know a lot about this.
But for black Americans in this country, it was a little defined by the terror.
In many communities, people were afraid to be little bite.
They worried about being bombed.
The threat of the terror was what his lives.
Now there are older people who come up to me and say, "Mr. Stevenson, you say talks to you, makes says, Dan to the people who stop saying that in our history we learned for the first time with terrorism, after 183.
They ask me to say, "No, say we grew up with that."
The era of terrorism continued to, obviously, with the segregated and decades of race and separation.
In this country we have a dynamic that we don't like to talk about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our story.
And that's why we haven't understood the meaning of what historically we've done.
All of the time we hit each other.
We constantly create tension and conflict.
It costs us to talk about race. I think it's because we're not willing to engage with a process of truth and reconciliation.
In South Africa, people understood that you couldn't overcome racial segregation without a commitment with truth and reconciliation.
In Rwanda, even before genocide had this commitment, but in this country we haven't done it.
I was in Germany giving conference on death penalty conference.
It was fascinating because one of the teachers stood after my presentation and said, "You know it's good worried to listen to what you say.
He said, "We don't have death row in Germany.
We can naturally never have it here."
The room was in silence and a lady said, "There is no way that with our story, we can never get into the systematic death of human beings.
It would be irrational that we, intentional and deliberately -- we were going to be able to execute people."
They reflect on this.
How would we feel in a world where a nation like Germany, would run people, especially if they were mostly about the Jews?
We couldn't tolerate it.
It would be irrational.
And yet, there is this disconnect.
I think our identity is in danger.
If we don't really care about these very difficult issues, the positive and wonderful things are -- however, they implicated.
We love innovation.
We are fascinated by technology. We worship creativity.
We love entertainment.
But finally, those realities are embedded by suffering, abuse, degradation, manual.
In my view, you need to integrate both things.
We just talk about the need to have more hope, greater commitment, more dedication with the basic challenges of this complex world.
I think that means spending more time thinking and talking about the poor, the desert, the ones that will never come to TED.
Think of them is, in a way, something that is within our being.
It's true that we need to believe in issues that we haven't seen.
So we are -- despite being so rational, so committed to the intellectual thing.
In innovation, with creativity. Developing comes not just from brain ideas.
These things come from ideas as well as the heart convictions too.
This connection of mind with heart is what drives us not only in the bright and developed, but also the dark and the hard.
Valley Harvard, the great camera leader, talked about this.
He said, "When we were in East Europe suffering the operation, we wanted all kinds of things, but mostly what we needed was hope, orientation for spirit, a willingness to be in places of despair and be testosterone."
Well, that orientation for spirit is practically in the heart of what I think is still in communities like TED, has to be commitment.
There is no disconnect related to technology and design, which allows us to be truly human if we don't pay attention to poverty, exclusion, inequality.
Now I want to warn you that these thoughts make a much more challenging identity than if we ignore these things.
We're going back to find them.
I had the great privilege being a very young lawyer to meet Rosa Parks to meet resources.
These women are just coming to talk to them.
Occasionally, Mr. Carl called me, to say, Brian, comes the lady Paris. We're going to meet to speak.
Do you want to come and listen to it?
I said, "Yes, ma'am, I do."
So she said, "Well, what do you do when you come from?"
I said, "Listen to you."
So I went and just listened to them.
It was very visualized, very lighting.
And at a time I was there, listening to these ladies, and after a couple of hours, Ms. Parks went to me and said, "Now Brian, tell me that it's that idea of equal justice.
Tell me what you're trying to do."
And I started giving my speech.
I said, "Well, we're trying to question injustice.
We try to help those who have been convicted of incompletely.
We try to confront prejudice and discrimination in criminal justice management.
We try to end up with life sentences without parole.
We try to do something about death penalty thing.
We try to reduce the population in prisons.
We try to end the mass income."
I gave him all my best speech, and he looked at me and he said, "Max memory momma.
And he said, "They'll be sleeping, very short."
At that point, Ms. Carl leaned up, put my finger on the face and said, "This is why you have to be very very bad."
I think actually, the TED community has to be much more valuable.
We have to figure out how to tackle those challenges, those problems, that suffering.
Because finally humanity depends on compassion for others.
I've learned some very simple things in my work.
I've been educated in simple things.
I've come to understand and believe that each of us is higher than the worst thing we have made.
I think that's true for everyone on the planet.
I'm convinced that if someone says a lie, it's not because it's a liar.
I'm sure if someone takes something that doesn't belong to you, it's not that it's a spilling.
Even if someone kills another, it is not that it's an assistant.
So I think there's a basic dignity in the people who must be respected by law.
I also believe that in many parts of this country, and certainly in many parts of the world, the opposite of poverty is not wealth.
That's not.
I really think that in many parts of poverty is justice.
And finally, I think that even though it's very dramatic -- very beautiful, very lighting, very straightforward, we don't judge us for our technology, for our design, not because of our intellectual or rational capacity.
At the end of a society, the character of a society, not the way they treat rich, powerful and privileged people, but by the way they treat the poor, the conditioned, the prisoners.
Because it's in this context as we start to understand truly profound issues about what we are.
I actually feel written. I'm going to end with a story.
Sometimes I do too much force.
Be tired, like all.
Sometimes those ideas go beyond my reasoning in an important way.
I've been representing these kids who have been sitting with a lot of drawing.
I go to prison, and I see my 13 and 14 years old, which have been made so that they are adding to them as adults.
And I start thinking, how can it be?
How can a judge turn someone into what it isn't is?
The judge does it as a grown-up, but I see a child.
A very late night was missing -- by God, if the judge can become something you don't are, you must have magical powers.
Yeah, Brazil, the judge has magical powers.
You should ask some of that.
As it was too late, I couldn't think of correctly, but I started working in a motivation.
I had a 14 year-old client a little bit, a little bit, a black black.
I started working in the motivation, with a gentleman that said, "Massive for my 14-year-old black client to be treated as a preferral white of 75 years, executive of a corporation."
In the motivation I found that there had been independent behavior in the accident, in the behavior of the police and the process.
There was a line on how in this country there is no ethics, but a whole lack of ethics in it.
At the next morning, I woke up thinking that wild motivation would be a dream, or actually write it?
For my horror, he didn't just have it, but he had sent her to the cut.
They spent about two months, I had forgotten it.
And finally I decided --  God, I have to go to the cut for this stupid case.
I went up to the car and felt really accumulating, automated.
I went in the car to the judge.
I thought this would be very difficult and beautiful.
I finally dropped out of the car. He walks the judge.
I was climbing the stairs when I found a larger black man -- it was the conference of the judge.
When I saw me, he came up to me and said, "Who is you?"
I said, "I'm a lawyer." He said, "Are you a lawyer? I said yes.
So I get up and open me.
And I was whispering in the ear.
He said, "I'm proud of you."
I have to tell you now that that was virus.
That's deeply connected to my interior, with my identity with the ability that we all have to contribute to the community with a vision of hope.
Well, I went into the audience room.
When I walked in, the judge saw me.
And he said, "Mr. Stevenson, you wrote this match match?
I said, "Yes, Mr. I was me." And we started discussing it.
People started coming in. They were all indicated.
I was the one who had written those crazy.
The cops came, the pessimists assistant, the administrations.
Suddenly, without knowing how, the room was full of people, all forces because we talked about races, because we talked about poverty, because we talked about inequality.
With the knee of the eye he came to see the advice that went and came on.
He looked out the window and he was able to hear all that screen.
I kept walking over here and there.
Finally, this old black, with the face of concern entered the room and sat behind me, almost on the table of the lawyers.
About 10 minutes later, the judge is going to decide a recession.
During the rest of a sugar of the algorithm was offered because the conservation had entered the room.
The assistant was been displaced about the old black.
And he said, "Jim, what do you do in the audience room.
And the old black stood stood up, looked at the assistant, looked at me and said, "I've got this audience room to tell this young man who kept his view in the goal with shortcut."
I've come today to TED, because I think many of you understand that the moral arc of the universe is very big, but it folds towards justice.
That we can't be truly human if we don't care about human rights and dignity.
That our survival is linked to each other.
That our visions of technology, design, entertainment and creativity must be brought to the fragile, compassion and justice.
And above all, to those of those of us who share this, I just want to tell you that they keep the view in the target of the shark.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You just heard and see an obvious desire of the audience, of this community, to help in your purposes to do something.
Something that's not a crash. What can we do?
BF: There are several close opportunities.
If you live in the state of California, for example, there will be a referendum this spring in which you will make an effort to reset the funds that are spending today in punishment policy.
For example, here in California, you're going to spend a billion dollars on death penalty in the next five years.
And despite this, 85 percent of the cases of homicide don't change in arrested.
65 percent of the rapes don't get to anything.
Here's an opportunity of change.
This reflection is going to propose that they get rid of these funds to make the law, to security.
I think there's a very close opportunity.
CA: There has been a huge decline in crime in the United States, in the last three decades.
Part of the explanation is that it has to do with the largest incarceration rate.
What would you say to those who think that is this?
BJ: Actually, the rate of creativity with violence has relatively been stable.
The great growth in massive incarceration in this country is not for crimes with violence.
It's the wrong war against drugs.
That's why this dramatic increase is coming into the cancer population.
And we let us convince the rhetoric retreat.
We have three legal causes to bring people to the perpetual chain -- to steal a bicycle, by small crimes against property instead of making those resources come to their victims.
I think we need to do more to help the victims of crime and not less.
It seems to me that our current philosophy about punishment doesn't do anything for anyone.
I think that's the orientation that has to change.
CA: Brian, we have exciting us today.
You're very inspiring.
Thank you very much for having come to TED. Thank you.

Peter Diamonds: These are just some of the clips that I got in the last six months. They could just be the last six days or for the last six years.
The idea is that the press means prefer to provide negative news because our minds are paying attention.
And that responds to a very good reason.
In every second of each day, our senses get a lot more data than probably the brain can process.
And as nothing matters more than survive, the first stop of all that data is an ancient fragment of the temporal lobe called a some amage.
The amygdala is our early warning detector, the danger detector.
Ordian and record all the information looking for something in the environment that could make us harm.
That's why a dozen stories will prefer to look at the negative.
That old would come from the press, "If there is blood. See, it's very true.
And because all digital devices give us negative news about seven days of the week, 24 hours a day, not to miss that we are pessimistic.
It's not surprising that people think that the world is going to be wrong.
But maybe not.
Maybe instead, what really happens is that we get disasters.
Maybe the enormous progress done in the last century for a series of forces is accelerating so that we have the potential to create a world of abundance over the next three decades.
I'm not saying that we don't have our good problems, climate change, species extinction -- water scarcity and energy -- certainly we have.
As human beings, we are very good to deal with problems, and in the long run, we end up with them.
So let's look at it in the last century to see where we go.
In the last hundred years, the average of life is more than doubled -- the average income per capita per capita has been tripled around the world.
Child mortality has been reduced 10 times.
Also, the cost of food, of electricity, of transportation and communications, has fallen 10 to 1,000 times.
Steve Pink showed us that we're living the most peaceful time in human history.
And Charles Kenya that global literacy went from 25 to over 80 percent over the last 130 years.
We're really living an extraordinary time.
A lot of people forget it.
And we keep getting more and higher expectations.
In fact, we redefine the meaning of poverty.
Think about it, today in America, a lot of the people who live under the poverty line have electricity, water, toilets, refrigerators, television, mobile, air conditioning and cars.
The marriages of the fall of the last century, the planets on the planet, would never have dreamed of such luxurios.
By supporting a lot of this is technology and lately its exponential growth.
My good friend Ray Kurzweil showed that any tool that comes in technology technology jumped in this curve, Moore's Law, and doubled the performance of price in about 12 to 24 months.
So the mobile phone that you have in the pocket is a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a supercomputer in the 1970s.
Now look at this curve.
It's Moore's Law for the last hundred years.
I want you to look at two things in this curve.
First, how smooth it is, in good and bad times, in war and peace in recession in depression and again.
It's the result of fast computers used to build faster.
It doesn't stop before any of the big challenges.
And even though it's graffiti in a law on the left, it's curve goes up.
The growth rate of technology is increasingly fast.
And in this curve, the Moore's Law Hardars, there's a series of extraordinarily powerful technologies that we have today.
The computation in the cloud, that my friends of Australia call infinite computing, sensors and networks, 3D printing and their ability to democratize and distribute personalized production all over the planet, synthetic biology, the fuels and the food, the diagnostics and the AIDS.
I mean, how many saw the victory in Jewish from Watson, about IBMA?
It was picture.
I was looking at newspapers the best headline that I would have.
And I loved this one: Watson beat to human opposites."
"Jeopardy" is not an easy game.
It plays with the nuances.
Imagine this artificial intelligence in the cloud, available for everyone in the mobile phone.
Four years ago, here at TED, Ray Kurzweil and I, launched a new university called Singapore University.
We teach these technologies to our students, and in particular, how they can be used to solve the great challenges of humanity.
And every year we asked them to launch a company, or a product or service, that can affect the lives of a billion people in a decade.
Think about that, the fact that a group of students today can impact a billion people.
Thirty years ago, that would have been absurd.
Today we can point out a dozen companies that have already done it.
When I think about creating abundance, it doesn't mean to create luxury lives for every single thing on the planet -- it's about creating a life of what possible.
It's about taking that which is scarce and getting it forward.
You see, scarcity is contextual and technology is a force that releases resources.
Let me give you an example.
It's a story of Nathan AIDS of the mid-1900s.
He's the guy on the left.
I invited to dinner the king.
Now the Nathan troops ate with silver covers, and the same National, with gold.
But the king of Simala, I ate with aluminum covered covers.
You see, aluminum was the most valuable metal on the planet -- it goes more than gold and plate.
So the tip of the monument to Washington is alimination.
You see, although aluminum is 8,000 percent of the Earth's mass, it doesn't come as a pure metal.
It's tied by oxygen and silicons.
But then the electron came up and made the aluminum so cheap that we used it as if it was destructive.
We put this analogy into the future.
Let's think about energy scarcity.
Ladies and gentlemen, we're on a planet dancing for 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year.
They get to the Earth 16 services of energy every 18 minutes.
It's not about scarcity. It's about accident.
And there's good news.
This year, for the first time, the cost of solar energy in India is 50 percent less than the generation of density: 8,000 rupees versus 17 rupees.
The cost of solar energy fell 50 percent last year.
Last month, MIT published a study that shows that at the end of the decade, in the sunny parts of the United States, solar electricity cost six cents the city circular per hour compared to 15 cents of national average.
And if we have energy abundance we also have plenty of water.
Let's talk about wars for water.
Do you remember when Carl San pointed out the Voyager Space Sandwich to the Earth, in 1990, after the Saturday country?
I took a famous picture. How was it called?
"A black dot blue."
Because we live on a water planet.
We live on a planet covered by 70 percent per water.
Yes, the 757, it's saltwater, two percent is ice, and we fight by the top billion of the planet, but also here is a hope.
It's a technology available not in 10 or 20 years, but right now.
The nanotechnology comes, the national ones.
In a conversation with Dean Kamen this morning, one of the innovators of the bias, I would like to share with you, I gave me permission to do -- his technology called Sheilleroid -- maybe you know -- it's the size of a small refrigerator.
It's able to generate a thousand liters of drinking water a day of any source -- water candles, container water, a letter, for less than two cents the gallon.
The president of Coke just agreed that making an important test of hundreds of these units in the developing world.
If that comes right, and I have a full confidence that it will be, Coca-Cola will implement it in 2006 countries on the planet.
This is an innovative innovation that exists today.
And we've seen it in mobile phones.
My God, we're going to get to 70 percent penetration in the developing world in the end of 2013.
Think about it, that dough warrior has better mobile communications in the middle of Kenya than President Reagan 25 years ago.
And to tell you a smart cell phone with Google, it has access to more knowledge and information than President Clinton 15 years ago.
It lives in a world of information and communications that nobody could have ever predicted before.
Better than that, the things that you and I have paid tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars -- GPS videos, images, images, books and music, medical diagnostic technology.
Maybe the best thing comes when the applications are survived.
Last month, I had the pleasure to announce with the Columbia Foundation something called the X Prime Algavel Army, of 10 million dollars.
We are challenging the teams of the world to combine these technologies in a mobile device that they talk, and because it has A.I. they can take blood from the finger.
To win it has to make better diagnosis than a certified medical equipment.
Imagine this device in the middle of the developing world where there are no doctors, where the load of morality is 25 percent and there are 1.3 percent of health workers.
When this device sequence a virus of RNA or DNA that doesn't recognize -- call the health of health, and first of all, prevent the pandemic happening.
But this is the biggest force of producing a world of abundance.
I call it the billions of increases.
The white lines here are the population.
We just went through the seven billion.
By the way, the best protection against the demographic explosion is to empower the world of education and health.
In 2010, we had less than two billion people online, connected.
By 2020, it will go from two billion to five billion users of the Internet.
Three billion minds of minds never heard of global conversation.
What would these people?
What are you going to do? What wish would you do?
And instead of an economic collapse, we will have the largest economic injection of history.
These people represent tens of billions of dollars embedded in the global economy.
And they will make more health thanks to the Archive, of a better education with the Academy Khan and because of the use of 3D printing and computing in the cloud to be more productive than ever before.
What can you give us three billion more members of humanity, educated and productive health."
How about a few voices before you heard before?
What if we give those operations, wherever they are, a voice to be heard and be able to act for the first time?
What will these three billion?
What if they are contributions we can't predict it?
Something that I learned with the X Prize is that small equipment, guided by their passion with a clear goal, can do extraordinary things, things that could only make great corporations and governments.
I'm going to end up sharing a story that really excites me.
There is a program that maybe some of you know.
It's called Football.
It emerged at the University of Washington, in Seattle.
It's a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids and figure out the way that protein will be made.
The folds determine structure and function.
It's very important in medical research.
And so far, it was a protocell problem.
They've played with this college professors, among others.
Then hundreds of thousands of people laughed and started playing it.
And it's shown that the machinery of recognition of human patterns is better by folding proteins than the best computers.
Ladies and gentlemen, what gives me enormous confidence in the future is that we have more power as people to take the big challenges on the planet.
We have the tools with this exponential technology.
We have the passion of the innovation of the balloon.
We have the capital of the technology.
And we have three billion new minds that will join us to work on the solution of great challenges and do what we should do.
We have a couple of extraordinary decades.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about a very small idea.
It's the correct point of the point.
And as the idea can explain in a minute, I will give you three examples to do time.
The first story is about Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
He was here, as you know, in 1838.
You may believe that it took a little bit, but it wasn't like that.
It actually collected fish.
And he described one of them as very common."
It was the member.
It was a lot of fish to the 1880s.
Now the fish is at the Red Rich list.
But we've heard this story many times, about Galapagos and other places, so that has nothing special.
But the case is that we still come to the Galapagos.
We still think they're prisoners.
The leaflets still say they follow intact.
So what happens here?
The second story, it also illustrates another concept.
Because I was there in 1978 studying a lagoon in West Africa.
I was there because I grew up in Europe, and then I wanted to work in Africa.
I thought I could try.
I burned a lot with the sun and I was convinced that I was not there.
This is my first exposure to the sun.
The guy was surrounded by palms, and, as you can see, from a few mangrove manufacturers.
There were the typical teams of about 20 centimeters the glass of black barrier.
And the fishing of this thylacine was very abundant and moved for a good moment, so it was earning more than the middle in Ghana.
When I was there 27 years later, the number of fish had gone down to half.
They were mastered by the five centimeters member.
They experienced a genetic pressure.
There were still fish.
In a way, they were still happy.
And the fish still were happy to be there.
I mean, nothing to change, but everything has changed.
My third story is that I was complicated in the introduction of the drag fishing in Southeast Asia.
In the 1970s, they started in the 1960s, Europe did a lot of development projects.
Peace development was supposed to impose countries that already had 100,000 fishermen to impose the industrial fishing.
And this boat, pretty ugly was called the Muslim four.
I went out fishing on him, and we did studies in southern China Marine and especially in the Aral Sea.
What we captured was something interesting.
We captured it, now I know, the bottom of the sea.
Ninety percent of what we capture were spirits, other animals that are at the bottom.
And most of the fish are tiny spots about a few remains, remains that are a fish of coral reefs.
In short, the bottom of the sea came to the cover and then was sleeping.
These images are extraordinary because transition is very fast.
In one year, you make a study and then start the commercial fishing.
The background happens to be a solid coral forest in this case, to be a lead.
This is a dead turtle, right?
They didn't eat them. They were discovered because they were dead.
Once we captured a living.
I was still not saved.
So they wanted to kill it because it was a good food.
This mountain of remains is what the fishermen collect every time they go to an area where they have never fish.
But it's not donated.
We transform the world, but we don't remember it.
We adjust the point of particular, to the new level, without remembering what was there.
If we generalize something like this.
In the axis, we have good things, biodiversity, lots of cards, the green of the country, the water supply.
And that changes over time. It changes because people do things with nature.
Every generation will use the images that are given to the beginning of their conscious life as normal and extracted forward.
The difference is that they perceive loss.
But they don't perceive the loss that happened before.
You can analyze the emergence of changes.
And at the end of the end keep a few different materials.
And that, in large measure, we want to do this now.
We want to keep things that are no longer what they were.
But you should think that this problem affects people when predatory societies kill animals without knowing what they've done to some generations later.
Because, obviously, an animal that is very abundant before you get extinct -- is very often.
You don't lose abundant animals.
You lose a little bit of frequent animals.
Even if this doesn't perceive as a big loss.
Over time, we focus on large animals, and in a synonymous sea of big fish.
They become very often because we fish.
Over time there are few fish, but we think that's the point of party.
And the question is, why do we accept this?
Well, because we don't know that it was different.
In fact, a lot of people, scientists, questioning that it was very different.
And they'll do it because the evidence presented in a previous way is not the way they would expect to have the evidence.
For example, the anecdote that some of you present, like you captain such a lot of fish in this area can't be used or generally don't use the fish scientists, because it's not scientific."
So we have a situation where people don't know the past, even though we live in instant societies, because they don't rely on the sources of the past.
From there the enormous role that can accomplish a protected marine area.
Because with protected marine areas, we really recreated the past.
We remember the past that people can't conceive because the point of game has run and it's just low down.
That is for the people who can see a marine marine area and they can benefit from the vision that provides it, which allows them to erase their point.
And what about people who can't do it because they don't have access to the Middle East, for example?
I think the arts and cinema may fill the vacuum. The simulation.
This is a simulation of the Chicago Bay.
A long time ago, there were gray whales in the Christian Bay 500 years ago.
And you'll have noticed that the mathematics and the tons are like "Avenue."
And if you think about "Avergume: if you think about why people come up with the movie -- without talking about the history of Portuguese, why are you going to get to the images.
Because it raises something that, in a sense, has been lost.
So my recommendation -- the only one who will give, is the only thing to do, is to do "The Internet "The water.
Thank you very much.
Hi. I'm Kevin Alfred, the German trend manager -- and I look at YouTube videos in a professional way.
It's true.
So we're going to see why the videos are doing viral and how important it is.
We all want to be stars, celebrations, singers, commands -- when I was younger, that seemed very, very difficult.
But today the web video makes any of us, or our actions, gives birth in a part of our global culture.
Anyone can do famous on the Internet in a sanitation.
Over 48 hours of video to YouTube per minute.
And of those, only a little percentage is made viral -- it gets infinite infinite and gains cultural momaician.
How does that happen?
Three things: trends of trends, participatory communities and surprise.
Well, let's start.
Beau Vasiba: Oh, my God, my God.
My God!
Wow.
Oh, woman."
KA: Last year, Pearl Vasinil published this video out of his house in the Yellowstone National Park.
In 2010, it was 23 million times.
This graph shows the reproduction in the population boom last summer.
Bear can't make a viral video.
I just wanted to share a double rainbow.
That's what you do if you're called YouTube Mountain Beau.
I had already published many videos of nature.
This video had been published in January.
So what happened here?
It was Jimmy Kimmer.
Jimmy Kimma published this tunnel that would kill the popular video.
trends of trends like Jimmy Kimma presented us new and interesting things and split them into a wider audience.
Rebecca Black,"  -- it's Friday, Friday, you have to start the Friday --  Everybody wants to get the weekend for the weekend.   Friday seven --  Friday --  Kare: You won't think we could have this conversation without talking about this video, I hope.
Ventures of Republic Black is one of the most popular videos of the year.
They saw it almost 200 million times this year.
This graph shows the use of use.
Like "Archimed "Step Dough," this video seemed to have arisen from nothing.
So what happened this day?
Well, it was Friday, it's true.
And if you ask those other peaks -- they're also Friday, too.
But what happened this day, this particular Friday day?
Well, I took it Tort, and many blogs started writing about it.
Michael J. Nelson, from Mission Scientific Three, was one of the first people to make a joke on Twitter.
But what's important is that one person or a group of trends of trends adopt a point of view and share it with a broader audience, accelerating the process.
So, this community of people who share this great internal joke then starts talking about that and doing things.
And now there's 10,000 paradigms of Vineemost on YouTube.
Just in the first seven days, there was a parody for each of the other days.
Unlike the international entertainment of the 20th century, this communal participation is our way of being part of the phenomenon -- by doing something new with that.
"Now Cameron is a repeat animation with a record music.
So, that's it.
This year you saw it about 50 million times.
And if you think that's rare, you know that there's a three hours version of it that has been seen four million times.
The cats saw this video.
And there are cats that saw other cats see the video.
But what's important here is the creativity that woke up between the Internet constant community.
There were remotes.
Someone made a version of the old one.
And then it became international.
Suddenly, a whole memory community came up with this that made this happen from being a stupid joke to something that we can all form part.
Because today we don't just enjoy, we participate today.
Who could have predicted something like this?
Who could have predicted "Army "Step Dough," or Republican Black or "Nover Cameron?
What do you want to have written that you would consider this situation?
In a world where you get two days of video per minute, only that really unique and unexpected can take away the way these things have done it.
When a friend told me that I had to look at this great video of a guy who protests against cycles in New York, admit that I don't care about it.
Casey Timescene: I was shocked by the bike -- but often there are obstacles that impose you right by the bike.
KA: Thanks to the surprise and his humor, Casey Time made five million watched and understood their idea.
So this approach is worth for all the new things we do in a creative way.
And all of this leads to a big question.
Roger Vascony: What does this mean?
Oh.
KA: What does this mean?
Tendencies of teaching, creative communities of participation, which is totally unexpected, are features of a new type of media, of a new culture, to which we all have access and is the audience that defines the popularity of it.
As I said before, one of the current celebrities in the world, Justin Vietnam, started on YouTube.
They don't ask permission to express their ideas.
Now we're all a little bit of our pop culture.
These are not the characteristics of the old media, they're just the current media, but define the entertainment of the future.
Thank you.
This is not a finished story.
It's a puzzle that is still training.
Let me tell you about some of the pieces.
Imagine the first piece -- a man burning the work of a whole life.
This is a poet, a dramatic, a man whose entire life had been supported in the unique and freedom of his country.
Imagine as the communist companies come in in San and stop the fact that their life had been totally in vain.
The words, for so long friends, now they did it.
It recovered in silence.
He died by history.
He's my grandfather.
I never met it.
But our lives are much more than our memories.
My grandmother never allowed me to forget his story.
My task was not to let that have been in vain and my lesson was to learn that history tried to get us off, but we support it.
The next part of the puzzle is about a boat to the dawn.
My mother, Mah, had only 18 years old when his father died, and a concerned marriage and two small girls.
For her, life had gone to one task alone, the escape of his family and a new life in Australia.
It was incentive for her that I couldn't get it.
And after a four years that challenged the fiction, a boat went down to the favorite sea of fishing fish.
All adults knew the risks.
The biggest fear was periods, rape and death.
Like most adults, my mother took a prisoner with poison.
If you capture us, first we would take my sister and I, and then she and my grandmother.
My first memories are from that boat, the constant pace of the engine, the program shaping on every wave and the horizon and the vacant horizon.
I don't remember the pirates that came over several times, but they were fooled with the valve of men in our boat, or the engine dying and couldn't run for six hours.
But I know the lights of the oil platform in front of the coast of Malaysia, and the young man who collapsed and died, to end the journey was too much for him, and the first apple I tried, because of the plants of the platform.
No apple had the same flavor.
After three months in a refugee camp, we set up in Melocry.
And the next piece of the puzzle is about four women over three generations, shaping a new life together.
We set up in Focuments, a kind of a classroom superconductor whose population is made of immigrants to it.
Unlike the average class suburbs whose existence was, in Fernand, there was no sense of the right.
The smells that come from the stores were from the rest of the world.
And the fragmented English fragments were traded between the people who had one thing in common: they were starting again.
My mother worked on farms, then on a car assembly line, working six days, double turbule.
Even so, I found time to study English and get a title at TED technology.
We were poor.
All of the dollars were assigned and established an extra tutor in English and mathematics, it wouldn't matter what you should take away, which was generally new clothes, always a second hand.
Two pairs of media for school, one to hide the holes of the other.
A school uniform to the rooms, because I had to last six years.
And there were weird and painful singers about the extreme eyes and some farmers, Asian, go home."
home, what?
Something in me was inspired.
He was accumulating determination and a voice that said, "I'm going to support it."
My mother, my sister and I slept in the same bed.
My mother was exhausted, but we told us about our day and we heard the movements of our grandmother in the house.
My mother suffered disappearing, all of the boat.
And my task was to be awake until his nightmare would start to get it off.
She opened a computer store, then he studied to be a static and opened another business.
And women came with their stories about men who couldn't make the transition and angry, and influences, and armed kids trapped between two worlds.
They were looking for subsidies and patterns.
They created centers.
I lived in parallel worlds.
In one, it was the classic Asian student, influenced with what I demand from myself.
In the other, I was embedded in precise lives, tragic limits of violence and drug abuse and insulation.
But many people received aid over the years.
And for that work, when I studied my last year of lawyer, I was elected by the Australian young year.
And I was caught from a piece of puzzle to the other, but his edges didn't fit.
So, Leone, I was so resilient from Focolo annoying, was now so Lego, refugee and social activist invited to speak in sites that I had never heard of, and in houses whose existence would never have imagined.
I didn't know the protocols.
I didn't know how to use the curves.
I didn't know how to talk about wine.
I didn't know how to talk about anything.
I wanted to give back to the routine and the comfort of life in a supermarket subjective -- a grandmother, a mother and two daughters ending the day as they did for almost 20 years, telling us about the day of each one and getting asleep, the three still in the same bed.
And I told my mom that I couldn't do it.
I remember that I had the same age that she had when we got to the boat.
The "no" had never been an option.
"They said, "I said, "And you're not what you don't.
So I talked about youth and education and destruction to the marginalized and the destroyed.
And the more frankly I talked about, the more it was connected to speak.
I met people from all the paths of life, many of them doing what they loved -- living in the frontier of the possible.
And even though I finished my license, I realized I couldn't stay in a sandwich race.
There had to be another piece of the puzzle.
And I realized at the same time that it's okay to be a stranger, a newly arrived, new on the scene -- and not only is it good, but it's something that will be grateful, maybe a gift of the boat.
Because being inside it can easily mean to make the horizon, it can easily mean accepting the assumptions of your provide.
I gave the enough steps outside my comfort zone to know that, yes, the world is destroyed, but not the way we fear.
possibilities.
There was an energy there, an inflated optimism, a rare mixture of humility.
So I followed my intuition.
I joined a small group of people who the motto can't be done, was a residential challenge.
For a year we didn't have a penny here.
At the end of every day, I made a giant soup of soup that we all share.
We worked all the way up to the night.
Most of our ideas were crazy -- but some bright ones, and we opened up.
I made the decision to move to the U.S.
After one journey.
My hearts again.
Three months later, I had moved on, and the adventure continued.
Before I finished, let me tell you about my grandmother.
She grew up in a time when Conference was social norms and the local Mandela was the person who cared about.
Life had not changed for centuries.
His father died shortly after she was born.
The mother raised it alone.
At 17 it became a condom of a Mandela whose mother beat it.
No support of his husband, caused a revolution to demand and bring the cause herself itself, and much more back when they win.
It can't be done to be wrong.
I was in the shower in the room of a hotel in Sydney when she died, a thousand miles in Menis.
I looked through the shadow of the shower and saw it standing on the other side.
I knew I had come to wake up.
My mother called minutes later.
Days later, we went to a Buddhist temple in Freudbeats and sat around his attention.
We told him stories, and we made sure we were still with it.
At night, a monkey came and told us that he had to close the aid.
My mother asked us to feel his hand.
I asked the monkey, "Why is her hand hot, and the rest of the body so cold?
"Because you've taken your hand since the morning, you said.
"You haven't sold it."
If there's a nerve in our family, that runs through women.
Given those who were and how life formed us, we can now see that men who have reached our lives would have frustrated us.
The defeat had easily agreed easily.
Now I want to have my own kids, and I wonder about the boat.
Who could wish that for you?
However, I fear the privilege of the easy, the right.
Can I give you a piece in your lives, supporting brave on each wave -- the material constraint of the engine, the vast horizon that doesn't guarantee nothing?
I don't know.
But if I could give it and see them safe.
Tribe Neisons, and also the mother of so is today, in the fourth or fifth row.
My story starts in Rajasthan. About two years ago.
I was in the desert, under the star sky, with the Sufi Solar Sandwish.
We were talking about how nothing has changed since the time of the ancient Indian epidemic.
In those days when the Indians wanted to travel to a car and we went through the sky.
Now we do it with airplanes.
At that time when I argue, the great Indian warrior in India, he had side, he took an arc and a floor to the floor, he got water.
We now do the same with tablets and machines.
The conclusion we took was that the machinery had replaced magic.
And that was a lot of fun.
Every time I felt a little bit more technique.
I was terrified by this idea of losing the ability to enjoy and appreciate an alarm if I didn't have the camera, if I couldn't touch my friends.
It seemed to me that technology had to allow the magic, not kill it.
As a child my grandfather gave me his pocket plate of pocket.
And this 10-year-old technology was for my most magical thing.
It became a golden door towards a world full of images, party and narratives in my imagination.
I had the feeling that mobile phones and luxury clock and cameras prevent that we do.
They free our inspiration.
And so I was launched, I was drawn to this technological world to see how to use it to create magic, rather than killing it.
It illustrates books.
So when I saw the iPad, I saw a narrative device able to connect the readers of the entire world.
You can know how we take the book.
Where we are.
Tour the text with the image, the animation, the sound and the touch.
The storytelling becomes more and more multiplications.
But what does that serve us?
I'm about to launch Kexi, an interactive application for iPad.
He says, "I put your fingers on every light."
And so ...  He says, "This box belongs to you." I write my name.
And so I become a character of the book.
In several moments I get a letter -- the iPad, the speech is where thanks to GPS -- which comes to me.
My inner child is excited about all these possibilities.
I've talked a lot about magic.
And I don't mean magicians and drugs, but to that magic of childhood, to those ideas that we were talking about.
For some reason, fireflies in a jar were always passionate to me.
So over here, we have to include the iPad.
And really, they lit your way into what it remains from the book.
Another idea that I was fascinated by girl was that a whole galaxy is in a board.
So here, every book and every world is transformed into a ticket that I drag into this magical device inside the device.
And this opens a map.
In every fantasy book there have always been maps, but they've been static maps.
This is a map that grows up, funded and guide for the rest of the book.
In certain points of the book as well.
Now I'm going to go in.
Another hugely important aspect for me is to create Indian content and at the same time.
These are the approved ones.
We've all heard of the bones and the children, but how many people outside India know their Indian contracts, would they get them?
These poor people have been trapped in the Indian cameras for millennia, in an old book.
So we're bringing them back into a contemporary child story.
In a story that deals with current issues like environmental crisis.
And talking about environmental crisis, one of the problems of the last 10 years has been that children have been locked up, painted their PCS, they haven't gone out the outside world.
But now with mobile technology, we can take our children into the natural world with their technology.
One of the interactions of the book is this adventure where you have to go outside the outside, take the camera or the iPad, and collect pictures of different natural objects.
As a child, I had a lot of collections: of stores, stones, guides and shops.
For some reason, kids don't do it.
So to reclaim this childhood ritual -- you have to go out and, in a chapter, take a picture to a flower and then label it.
In another chapter, you have to take a picture of a piece of cortex and then label it.
So you create a digital collection of photos that you can then put on the Web.
A kid from London puts a picture of a shoe and says, "Oh, I saw a shoe."
A child in India says, "I saw a monkey."
And it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital photos that have been taking off.
Inside of the controller variants between magic, Earth and technology there are many possibilities.
In the next book we were trying to have an interaction in which you go out with the iPad, and the video on and through augmented reality sees a group of animated stores that appear on the inner plants of the house.
At a moment, the screen is full of leaves.
And you have to make the sound of the wind and be able to be able to read the rest of the book.
We go to a world where nature forces are intertwined with technology and magic and technology about each other.
Let's take advantage of the sun.
We're approaching our children and ourselves the natural world and that magic, joy and child love that we sat through a simple story.
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about why a lot of health projects fail.
And I think, really, the most important thing about that is that we stop listening to patients.
And one of the things we did at Raffer University was to go to a direction of listening.
And not in a very scientific way, she took a little cup of coffee or tea and asked patients, family and well-known -- what happens?
"How can we help it?
And we tend to think, that this is one of the biggest problems for what everyone or maybe not all, but most of the health projects fail, because we stop listening.
This is my Wikilitary basketball. It's very simple.
It has a pick up and off.
Every morning I got up.
And yes, I have a challenge as you can see.
I got the challenge to get to 95 kilograms of it.
But it's so simple, that every time I connect me, I send my information to Google Health.
And my head doctor has access to him as well. So he can see what my weight problem, not at the same time when you need cardiovascular assistance or some urgency of that style, but see it backwards.
But there's something else.
As some of you know, I have over 4,000 followers on Twitter.
So every morning I connected to my Wikilite basketball and before I climb my car, people start talking to me, "Luxing, today I think you need a light lunch.
That's the best thing that can happen, because it's pressure of the pairs used to help patients, because it could be used for obesity, and also for patients to stop smoking.
On the other hand, it can be employed to move people from their chairs and to develop some recreational activity to have more control of their health.
From the next week being available.
This little breakfast committed to an iPhone or another device.
And people can get from their homes, take their blood pressure, send them to their doctor, and share it with others, for example, for 100 dollars.
This is the point where patients assume a position, and they go back to the control and be capital of their own boat, but it can also help us care of health care because of the challenges that we face, like the firing of the costs of medical attention, the doubling of demand and other issues.
To do techniques that are simple to use and start with this to engage patients on the team.
And they can do it with techniques like this, but also by crowds.
And one of the things we did want to share with you with a video.
We all have navigation control in cars.
Maybe we even have them in our cell phones.
We know perfectly where the automatic fields are in Macartorian.
And also where all the gas are.
And of course, we can find fast food chains.
But where is the nearest DESAs to help this patient?
We ask, but nobody knows.
Nobody knew where to get the DNA saved lives right now.
What we did was we made corruption in the Netherlands.
We created a website, and we asked the audience to say, you see a DNA, please send it, and when it's open, because sometimes open in office hours and others are closed.
And over 10,000 DNA already presented in the Netherlands.
The next step was to look for the application for that.
And we made an app for the iPad.
We created an app for Lake, augmented reality, to find these DNA.
And every time you're in the city of Macartocology and somebody collapses. You can use your iPhone, and the next weeks to use your microscope of Microsoft to find the nearest DNA, which can save lives.
And from today, I want to present this one, not just like DNA 29, which is the name of the product, but also as AIDS.
And we will want to start in global level.
We're taking all the colleagues in the world, in other universities, to help us find, work and act like a center for the computer service around the world.
Every time you're out of vacation and somebody collapses, it can be a person or someone in front of you, you can find it.
I would also want to invite companies around the world that could help us value these DNA.
They could be a message services or phone people, for example, to see if the DNA that's shown is still in place.
Please help us in this and not just improve health, but take control of it.
Thank you very much.
I'm here to share my photograph.
Or is it photographer?
Because, of course, they're photographs that can't take with their cameras.
My interest by photography was woke up with my first digital camera at 15 years.
He was mixed with my passionate passion for the drawing but it was a little bit different because when he used the camera the process was in planning.
And when you take a photograph with a camera the process ends when you press the pulse.
For me, the photograph had more than to do with being in the right place, at the time.
It seemed to me that anybody could do it.
So I wanted to create something different, a process that would start by pressing the pulling poll.
Photos like this: a building in a very trained road.
But it has an unexpected turn.
And despite it, it keeps a level of relationship.
Or pictures like this, dark and colors at the same time, but with the common goal of keeping the level of relationship.
And when I say religion I say photographic.
Because, of course, it's not something that I can capture but I always want it to seem to have been captured in a way as a photograph.
pictures where you will have to think about a moment to discover the trick.
It has more than to do with capturing an idea that with capturing a moment.
But what is the trick that makes them seem real.
Is it the details or the colors.
Is the light?
What does the illusion do?
Sometimes the illusion is the perspective.
But in the end, it's about our way to interpret the world and how you can perceive in a two-dimensional surface.
It's actually not about whether it's realistic but what we think is realistic.
So I think the foundations are very simple.
I see it as a puzzle of reality in which we take different pieces of reality and put them together to create alternative reality.
Let me show you a simple example.
Here we have three perfectly imaginative objects, something that we can all relate to the three-dimensional world.
But combined in a certain way can create something that even seems three-dimensional -- as if it exists.
But at the same time, we know that it doesn't exist.
So we get into the brain because the brain doesn't accept the fact that it really doesn't make sense.
And I see the same process by combining pictures.
It really consists of combining different realities.
And the things that make a picture look realistic -- I think they are those where we don't even think, things that surround us in our everyday life.
But by combining photographs is very important to consider it, because otherwise something will look bad.
So I would like to say that there are three simple rules that will continue to achieve realistic results.
As you can see, these images are not very special.
But combined, you can create something like this.
So the first rule is that the combination of photos must have the same perspective.
Second, the photos combined must have the same kind of light.
And these two images come together with these requirements -- they were taken to the same height and with the same kind of light.
The third point is to make it impossible to distinguish the principle and end of different images with a perfect joint.
It has to be impossible to see where the image is.
This is another example.
You might think that this is the image of a landscape and the bottom is manipulated.
But this image is totally composed by photographs of different places.
In the staff, I think it's easier to create a place than finding it because you don't need to put the ideas in your head.
But it requires a lot of planning.
And as I thought this idea in winter I knew that I had several months to plan it, to find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle.
For example, the fish was captured in a fishing journey.
The costs are from a different location.
The underwater part was captured in a piece of rock.
And yes, I even made the house at the top of the island to seem more Sweden.
So to make a realistic outcome, I think it takes planning to do it.
You always start with a sketch, an idea.
Then you have to combine the different pictures.
And here every piece is very well thinking.
If you do a good job when you take the pictures, the result can be very beautiful and at the same time.
All the tools are there and the only limit is our imagination.
Thank you.
I'll start showing a slide about technology, very boring.
Please, if you can put it.
It's a diagram that I took from a card mine.
I'm not interested in showing you the details but the general thing.
This is an analysis that we were doing about the power of RISD microscopes versus the power of local area networks.
What's interesting about this is that this one, like many other ones that we tend to see, is a kind of straight line in logarithmic scale.
In other words, every step here represents an order of magnitude on the performance scale.
To talk about technology with space curves is a novel thing.
Something weird is happening.
And that's what I'm going to talk about.
Please turn the lights.
I would need more intensity because writing about paper.
Why do we plot technological curves in locality scales.
The answer is that if I draw them into a normal curve where we say, these are the years, or some time unit, and this would be any measure of the technology that I wanted to draw, the diagram would look ridiculous.
It would be something like this.
It doesn't say a lot.
But if you plot it, for example, some other technology, like transportation, in a seminal curve would be very silly, we would see a straight line.
But if something like this, you give a qualitative change.
If the technology of transportation is going to move as fast as the microscope, the morning we could take a taxi and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds.
But it doesn't move to that rhythm.
There are no precedent in the history of technological development of a freedom that every few years advance orders of magnitude.
The question I want to plan is -- looking at these exponential curves -- we see that they're not going to happen.
It's not possible to sustain this change as fast as it goes.
It will happen one of two things.
Or it's going to become a typical curve I know like this until it gets something completely different, or maybe I'll do something like this.
That's everything that can happen.
I'm optimistic, so I think maybe something like that.
In being that, we would now be in the middle of a transition.
In this line, we are in a transition of what used to be the world, to a new way.
So what I try to ask, and ask me, what is that new way that I adopt the world?
What new state does the world look like?
transition seems very, very confusing if we're immersed in it.
I remember as a child in 2000, and people used to talk about what would happen in 2000.
This is a conference where people talk about the future, and we see that the future is still the year 2000.
That's all we see.
In other words, the future has embedded, year after year, along my life.
But I think it's because we feel that something is happening.
We can feel it.
And we know that it doesn't have much sense to think about 30 or 50 years because it will all be so different than extraordinarily what we're doing today doesn't make any sense.
So I want to talk to you about how it might be, how it might be that transition that we experience it.
But to do that, I will have to talk a little bit about things that don't have much to do with technology and I.T.
Because I think the only way to understand it is to take distance and look at the long-term things.
The scale of time that I'd like to do that is the time of life on Earth.
I think this image makes sense if we look at it every billion years.
So we went back about 2.5 billion years when the Earth was a big sterile rock with many chemicals that float around it.
If we look at the way that chemicals are organized -- we give us an idea of how things happen.
And I think there are theories to start understanding the origin with RNA -- I'm going to tell you a simple version of this, and that's that, at that time, there was a flow of oil droplet with all kinds of chemical recipes inside.
Some of those oil droplet contains a particular combination of chemicals that made them incorporate materials from the outside, and so the droplets grew up.
They began to divide it.
In a sense, those were the most primitive forms of mobile computers, those oil gifts.
But those grandmothers were not alive, in the current sense, because each of them contained a random recipe of chemicals.
And every time they were divided by an unequal distribution of the chemicals that they make.
So every drop was a little different.
In fact, the droplets that somehow they were defined by being better at the time of incorporating the certain chemicals -- they grew more, they incorporating more chemicals and they divide more.
They usually lived longer. They were more represented by it.
It was a form of life, chemical life, very simple, but things were made interesting when these droplets learned the trick of abstraction.
In some ways we don't understand very well these grates learned to store information.
They learned to keep information, which was the recipe of the cell, in a special chemistry called DNA.
In other words, they worked in this meaningless evolution, a writing system that allowed them to record what they were in order to replicate it.
The amazing thing is that that writing system seems to have remained stable since they evolved two billion years ago.
Our recipe, our genes, have exactly the same code, that same writing system.
In fact, every living is expressed with exactly the same set of letters and the same code.
And one of the things I did just for fun -- now we can write things with this code.
Here I have 100 milligrams of white dust that I try to hide the security people of the airport.
But it contains -- I took this code -- the code has the common letters that we used to use in this -- and I wrote my personal data in this DNA fragments and amplified it 10 to 22 times.
So if someone wants 100 million copies of my personal card -- I have a lot of them for all the present, in fact, for every person in the world, and it's here.
If it was a class would have put it in a virus and would have spread it through the room.
What was the next step.
Writing DNA was an interesting step.
This made these cells happy another billion years old.
But then another big step happened in which things were very different, and it was that these cells began to exchange and communicate information by forming cells of cells.
I don't know if you know, but bacteria can exchange DNA.
So for example, they evolved resistance to antibiotics.
Some bacteria found the way they avoid penicillin and they took them to create their little DNA with other bacteria, and now there are many residents to penicillin because bacteria communicate.
This communication gave place to be formed by communities that were in some ways, and they were set together in that, and they set up a synergies in it.
And so they survived or failed together, or that if a community was very successful all the individuals of that community were explained more and they were favorite by evolution.
And the tipping point happened when these communities were so close that, in fact, they joined and decided to write all the recipe of the community together in a DNA chain.
The next interesting stage for life took another billion years.
And in that stage, we have multicellular communities, communities of many different cells working together as a single organism.
In fact, we are a multi-profit community.
We have a lot of cells that don't act alone.
The skin cell doesn't serve without the heart, or the muscles or the brain, and so on.
So these communities evolved and produced more interesting levels than the cell phone, something we call an organism.
The next level happened within these communities.
These started to absorb information.
And to build very special structures that didn't do more than process in community.
It's the neural structures.
The neurons are the devices that process information that those cell communities built.
In fact, they began to specialize within the community being the responsible structures to register and understand and transmit information.
Those were the brains and the nervous system of those communities.
And that gave them an evolutionary advantage.
Because at that time as individuals, learning was confined to the duration of an organism, and not the even evolutionary time.
So an organism could, for example, learn not to eat some fruit because he knew bad and sick the last time he ate it.
That could happen during the life of an organism given that they had built these processing structures of information that for evolution would have learned for hundreds of thousands of years by death of individuals that ate that fruit.
So the fact that the nervous system will build those structures of information that are extremely accelerate the evolutionary process.
Because evolution could now happen to an individual.
It could happen in the time you need to learn.
But then, of course, individuals discovered the trick of communication.
So for example, the most refined version we know is human language.
If we think about it, it's an incredible invention.
I have a very complicated idea of a vague idea, in your head.
I'm sitting here by emitting a bunch of groups, and hopefully building a similar idea, vast and confusing, in your heads that saved some analogy with mine.
But we take something very complicated we become sound, in sound, and we produce something very complicated in another brain.
That's now allowing us to start working as an organism.
In fact, as humanity, we've started to make abstractions.
Now we go through similar periods to the multicellular organisms, we abstract our methods of record, presentation and information processing.
For example, language invention was a little step in that direction.
The phone, the computer -- the video tape, the CD.
And that fits us in something much larger, faster and able to evolve more than we did before.
Now evolution can happen in microseconds now.
You saw the evolutionary example of you in which it produced a certain evolution with the convergence program.
And now we've accelerated the scale scales again.
The first stages of the story that told them took a billion years each.
The next stages, the nervous system and the brain, took a few hundred million years.
The next one, language and so on, took less than a million years.
And the next one, like electronics, seems to take just a few decades.
The process is feeding up. I guess that automatic is the right word to name something that accelerated its own pace of change.
The more changes, the faster it does.
And I think that's what we see in this explosion of the curve.
We see the process feeds down.
But I make my life designing computers, and I know that the mechanisms that I work to design them would not be possible without recent computer breakthroughs.
But now I design objects of such complexity that would be impossible for me to design them in a conventional way.
I don't know that it does every transistor in that connection machine.
There are billions.
Instead, with the designers of Thick Machines, we think of a level of abstraction -- we put it in the machine and the machine with that does something that you can't do before, it gets much further and faster than ever before.
In fact, sometimes employed methods that we don't even understand well.
A particularly interesting method that I've been using last is the evolution itself.
We put into the machine an evolutionary process that operates on the scale of microbes.
And for example, in the most extreme cases, we can evolve a program from an random sequence of instructions.
We say, "Please, you can run a hundred million sequences of service in land?
Could you run these sequences of sharks at random, run all those programs, and take those who are more about what we want to do?
In other words, I define what I want.
Let's say I want to order numbers, to put a simple example.
So we found the programs that are more about creating numbers.
Of course, it's unlikely that some random sequences of instructions, order numbers, so none of them did it.
But one, luckily, could take two numbers in the right order.
And I said, computer, could you take 10 percent of those random sequences that they did the task?
We do those and we remove the rest of them.
And now we reproduce the ones that are best ordered the numbers.
And we went back to play them following a process of analog recording to sex.
So let's take two programs, which will bring kids, who are exchanging subtletimers, and that children inherit the properties of both programs.
So we got a new generation of programs of programs that had a little bit more success.
And we say, "Please repeat the process."
He ratings again.
Some mutations introduced some mutations.
And it tries again and it represents another generation.
Well, every generation takes a few milliseconds.
So I can make the equivalent to millions of years of evolution in a few minutes or in complicated cases, in a few hours.
At the end, we ended up with programs that order numbers in absolutely perfect ways.
In fact, they're much more efficient programs than I could have written by hand.
If I look at those programs I can't say how they work.
I've tried to analyze them to see how they work.
They are dark programs -- strange progress.
But they turn the comet.
In fact, I know, I have the security that they get the goal because they come from a lineage of hundreds of thousands of programs that made it.
In fact, their lives depend on it.
I was once in a 747 with Martin Minister and pulled up a card and says, "Look at this.
He says, "This airplane has hundreds of thousands of participants working together to offer a safe flight. Don't make you feel really really really really really really cheap?
We know engineering processes don't work very well when they get complicated.
So we started to depend on computers to make good design processes.
And that allows us to produce things much more complex than the normal engineering.
But we don't understand all the choices that there are.
In that sense, it goes in front of us.
Now we use those programs to make computers much faster, and so we can run these programs much more quickly.
I mean, it's feeding.
The thing goes faster and faster and that's why I think it looks so confusing to me.
Because all these technologies are feedback.
We're standing away.
And we are at an analog moment to the single-celled organisms when they became multiplication.
We are the threats and we can't understand what the hell we are creating.
We're at the tipping point.
But I think something comes behind us.
I think it would be very arrogant from our part to think that we are the end product of evolution.
And I think that all of us are part of the creation of whatever it is.
But now comes the lunch and I think I'm going to stop here before I get eliminated.
I think we need to do something with a part of the medical culture that has to change.
And I think this starts with a doctor, and that's me.
And I've made enough time to allow me to pick up part of my false prison in that.
Before I deal with the theme of my talk, we talk a little bit of baseball.
Why not?
We're close to the end, the World series.
We love baseball, right?
The baseball is full of amazing statistics.
There are hundreds of statistics.
It's about going out "In "Roman the Rules," talking about statistics and using them to form a great baseball team.
I'm going to focus on one of them, and I hope many of you know it.
It's called battery average.
And we talked about 300 from a battery that batteries 300 dollars.
That means that basic battery effectively, three of 10 times.
That means throwing the ball into the game of game without being abstracted, and anyone who tries to launch it into the first base, don't get to time, and the second base will be saved.
Three attempts from 10.
Do you know how they call a 300 battery battlefield in the Great Legos?
Well, really good, maybe the team of stars.
Do you know how they call a 400 baseball battery of 400?
By the way, that's someone that 10 hits -- access four.
Germany -- like the legendary Ted Williams, the last largest player of Liberia Mosteria to run more 400 hits in a regular season.
Now let's take this to my world of medicine where I feel much more comfortable or maybe less uncomfortable, after what I'm going to tell you today.
Suppose they have advanced and they are devoted to a surgeon that has also a 400 year-old record.
So it doesn't work, right?
Now suppose that they live in a sleeping place, and a loved person has two clogged corruption arteries and their family doctor led to a cardiac whose record in angle is 200 of them.
But you know something?
She's actually improving this year.
And their acts have been 275.
This is not working.
But I'll ask you.
What do you think it should be the average of access of a heart or orthopedic surgeon of a nurse or a general obstacle?
One, very good.
And the truth of the issue is that no one in all medicine knows the acts of a good surgeon, a doctor or a doctor.
What we do, though, is to send them into the world, and I get involved with the manipulation of being perfect.
What they never, ever make a mistake and concern to figure out how to do well.
That was the message that I was in the medical school.
I was a computer observation student.
Once a fellow in high school said that Brian Golden studied until a blood test.
That's why.
I studied in my little desire, at the head of the General Hospital of Toronto, not far from here.
And I learned all of memory.
From my class of anatomy -- I memorized the origin and the muscle work, the branching of every single artery that comes out of the airport, the difficult difference and not the usual non-state.
And I even knew the different diagnosis about how to classify kidney towering charges.
And as much more and more knowledge.
And I was very good. I graduated with honor.
And the mermans of medicine school with the impression that if you memorize everything, then you would know everything, or the most possible, close to everything, because so I would imagine mistakes.
And it worked for a while, until I met the lady Drug.
I was resident in a college hospital here, in Toronto, when they brought the lady Drug to the emergency service where I was working on.
At that time, I was assigned to the heart service.
And when I was able to be able to go to a cardiologist I was going to hit that patient.
It will report the boss of residents.
When I saw the lady Drug, I was stopping.
I heard a remarkable sound.
And when I did it, I heard a brown sound in both sides, which was a conflict heart failure.
In these conditions, the heart stops working, and instead of pumping the blood forward, the blood goes to the lungs, they fill out of blood, and so there's difficulty to breathe.
And it wasn't hard to diagnosis.
I did it and I went to work on the treatment I would give him.
I gave him aspiration and medication to alleviate pressure in his heart.
I gave him diagnostics, water planners, so that I could eliminate liquid.
And in an hour or two, she started feeling better.
And I felt very good.
And that's when I started the first mistake, he sent her home.
Actually, I ate two more mistakes.
He sent her to her house without talking to the head of residents.
I didn't raise the phone I did not do what I should have done, which was to call my boss and put it with him to see it.
And if my boss would have seen it, it would have been able to get competitive information.
Maybe I did it for a good reason.
Maybe I didn't want to be a resident that requires constant attention.
Maybe I wanted to be so successful and able to assume responsibility, that I could take care of my patients without even contact my boss.
The second mistake I ate was worse.
When I sent it to his house, I didn't pay attention to a voice in my inner and say, "Google, it's not a good idea. Don't do it."
In fact, I was so insecure. I was so insecure.
And the nurse thought and then said totally natural, "Yes, I think I'll be good."
I remember that as if it was yesterday.
So he signed the high, and the ambulance along with the doctors took her home.
And I went back to the hospital room.
The rest of that day, that afternoon, I had a bad pressure on the stomach.
But I followed my job.
At the end of the day, I packaged to leave the hospital and walk into the parking parking man where my car was to go home. At that time I did something that I don't normally do.
I went through the emergency service of the way home.
And there another nurse, not that I cared about the lady Drug before, but another one. He told me three words -- those three words that most of the emergency doctors fear.
Other specialists are afraid too, but there's a particular thing in empathy, and it is that we see patients.
The three words are: Do you remember you?
"Do you remember the patient that sent your house?
I asked the other nurse with total nature.
"Well, she comes back." With the same voice tone of voice.
She was fine.
But they went back and on the edge of death.
And after an hour of having reached his house, after I gave her the high school, he suffered a collapse and his family called 911 -- the doctors brought her to emergency with an arterial pressure of 50 millimeters from Haiti, which means a severe shock.
I was barely breathing and was blue.
The emergency staff deployed all their resources.
They gave them medication to get the blood pressure up.
They put an artificial breath.
I was shocked and sound to the cord.
I had a sense of feelings because after the stabilize was in intensive therapy and waiting against all hope that would recover.
And in the two or three days following it was obvious that I would never disappear.
He had an irreversible brain.
The family came together.
And in eight or nine days, they were resistant to what was happening.
And at the ninth day, they let him go. Mr. Drugs, wife, mother and grandmother.
They say they never forget the names that they die.
That was my first experience.
The next week, I was punished by it, and I experienced for the first time the massive shame that exists in our medical culture, and I felt like just, isolated without feeling that healthy shame because you can't talk to your colleagues.
You make the peace and never make that mistake.
It's that shame that leaves a teaching.
The evil shame I talk about is what makes us feel very bad at it.
It's the one that tells us not that what we did was wrong, but we are bad.
And that felt like that.
And it wasn't for my boss -- he was a love.
I talked to the family, and I'm sure that I sort of smart things and make sure they wouldn't get me.
And I kept asking those questions.
Why didn't I ask my boss? Why did I send her to his house?
And in my worst moments, why did I make a mistake so storm?
Why did I choose medicine.
Little by that feeling was disappointed.
And I started feeling better.
And in a cloudy day, the sky opened up and finally came out the sun, and I wondered if I would feel better again.
And I did a deal with myself in which if I broke the efforts to be perfect to not make more mistakes, it would make those voices.
And so it did.
I went back to work.
But it went back to happen.
Two years later, it was help in the emergency department in a community hospital north of Toronto, and I got a 25 year-old man with a pain in the throat shark.
I was very busy and approached.
And he was sitting here.
I looked at his throat -- I was a little colored here.
He was worried about penicillin and sent him home.
But as he went to the door he kept pointing out his throat.
Two days later, when I came to do my guard change, my boss asked to talk to me in his office.
And I published the three words: Do you remember you?
Do you remember the patient who saw a pain in the sweet?
And he came back and he didn't have a strategic figure.
He had a potentially fatal condition called epidemics.
You can Google it in Google -- it's an infection, not of the throat, but of the upper air, and that can cause the closing of those tracks.
He did not fail.
You add antibiotics to be interviewed and recovered to the few days.
And through the same period of shame and reputations, then I was relieved and went back to work, until over and over again, and again.
Two times in the same emergency rate, you don't diagnose applications.
And it's a big effort, especially working in a hospital, because it was after 14 patients at the same time.
But in both cases, I didn't send them home, and I don't think it's been a challenge.
One of them thought I had a kidney calculation.
They ordered a richest rate, but it turned out normal, a colleague that was checking the patient perceived some sensitivity in the bottom right square and called the surgeon.
The other patient was with a lot of diarrhea.
They order liquid to red and asked my colleague to check it.
You reviewed it and by noticing some sensitivity in the lower right quadrant, called the surgeon.
They were both operated and received well.
But every case, I was streaming to me.
But I'd like to tell you that I made the worst mistakes in the first five years of exercise and like many colleagues say, it's a beam.
The most significant ones have been for the last five years.
Just embarrassed and without support.
And here's the problem: If I can't stand up and talk about my mistakes, if I can't find the voice that tells me what really happens, how can I share this with my colleagues.
How do I teach them this so that they don't make the same mistakes?
If I would go now to a place like this, I had no idea what you think about me.
When was the last time you heard someone talking about failure, after failure, after failure?
Of course in a party you'll hear the mistakes of other doctors, but you won't listen to someone talking about your own mistakes.
And if I knew and my colleagues as well, that a transparency in my hospital made the wrong leg, believe me that would have difficulty to look at the eyes.
This is the system that we have.
The total denial of mistakes.
It's the system where there are two positions: the ones that make mistakes and the ones that can't sleep and the ones that have the results and the ones that have great outcomes.
And it's almost like an ideological reaction, like antibodies that start attacking that person.
We have the idea that if we go from medicine to people who make mistakes, we will have a safe system.
But that brings two problems.
In 20 years of specialist and medical journalism, I've made a personal study of bad medical practice and medical errors to learn the possible, from the first article I wrote for the Star Street to my program, White Coar, Black Art."
And what I learned is that mistakes are organized.
We work in a system where mistakes happen every day, where one of every 10 drugs prescription in the hospital are wrong, or documenting is not right -- in a system where the intrinsic infections are increasingly more and more numerous by creating chaos and death.
In this country, they die 24,000 Canadian medical errors in this country.
The U.S. Medical Institute established 100,000 dollars.
In both cases, it's about blood subjects, because we are not discovering the problem as we should.
And so they're things.
A hospital system where knowledge is multiplied every two or three years, and we don't update us.
The dream of sleep invaded everything.
And we can't get rid of it.
We have cognitive biases that allow you to make a perfect history of a patient with chest pain.
Now, let's take the same patient with a pain on the chest, it comes up with crazy eyes and with alcohol to alcohol, and suddenly my story is the disappearance.
It's not the same story.
I'm not a robot. I don't do things always as well.
And my patients are not cars. They don't reflect their symptoms always in the same way.
So the mistakes are inevitable.
So if we take the system as they taught us, and we eliminate all the professional professionals to error, well, I won't have no one.
And with respect to people don't want to talk about their most serious cases.
In my program, "Ladie Black, black art, is already a custom say, "This is my worst mistake. I would say to everybody, from the doctors to the heart surgery, this is my worst mistake, blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah -- "What are your mistakes? And it will run the microphone to them.
And their students would stop, they would go back, they would go down the head and they would go out and start counting their stories.
They want to tell their stories, they want to share them.
They want to be able to say, "Look, don't make the same mistake.
They need a context where they can do it.
They need a redefined medical culture.
And it starts with a doctor every time.
The reproductive physician is human, you know human, you accept it, and you don't get rid of your mistakes, but you are effort to learn from what happens to teach others.
It shares their experiences with them.
It's support for those who talk about their mistakes.
It pointed out the mistakes of other people not with the intention of taking them, but in a loving and the support of support for everyone to benefit with.
And it works in a medical culture that recognizes that human beings are going to run the system, and when this happens, they make mistakes every time.
My name is Brian Golden.
I'm a reproductive doctor.
I'm human, I make mistakes.
And I feel a lot of it, but I'm effort to learn something that can transmit others.
I don't know what they think about me, but I can live with that.
And let me conclude with three personal words, I remember it.
Do you know how many decisions do we take one day?
Do you know how much we choose in a week?
I recently made a survey to over 2,000 people and the average amount of choices that say to choose an average American -- it's about 70 a day.
It doesn't do a lot, in a research followed for a week to a group of businesses.
The researchers recorded the different tasks that are shown by these executives and time they started making decisions with those tasks.
They found that, on average, 193 jobs a week.
Naturally, every job included many ministers.
Half of those decisions took nine minutes or less.
Only 12 percent required an hour or more of their time.
Now think about your election.
Do you know how many people belong to the nine minutes, and how many of the time?"
How do you qualify the way that you manage those decisions?
Today I want to talk about one of the biggest problems of the current today: choose to the open of choices.
I want to talk about the problem and some possible solutions.
As I talk about this, I'm going to ask you a few questions and I need to know your answers.
When I ask a question, like I'm blind, raise your hand just if you want to burn calories.
Otherwise, when you ask a question, if your answer is positive please give a pandemic.
And now my first question of the day, are you ready to hear about the problem of supercomputer supply."
Thank you.
Being graduate student at Stanford University, I discovered this very, very high level supermarket at least at the time it was very sophisticated.
It was called Dragonism.
It was almost like going to a amusement park.
There were about 250 different kinds of mustard and vibration, over 500 different types of fruits and vegetables and about 25 of the water water, and this was when we were taking water water.
I loved going to that store, but in a occasion, I wondered, why never buy anything?
This is the standard of the olive oil.
They had more than 75 different classes, including those who were in sealed box that came from military trees.
I once decided to visit the manager and asked him, "Did this strategy of offering all these choices?
He pointed out the buses full of tourists that came every day, usually with their cameras.
We decided to make a little experiment with the migrations.
Step.
They had 64 different classes.
We installed a position to say, right at the entrance of the store.
We put out there miles of six flavors or 24 different flavors and we looked at two things: First, how many people were willing to stop to try the migration?
More people stopped when there were 24 percent, 60 percent, that when there was only six, 40 percent.
We also looked at what case they were more likely to buy a military torture.
Here we find the opposite effect.
Of those who stopped when there were 24 -- only three percent came to buy migration.
Of those who stopped when there were six, we saw that 30 percent bought migration.
If we do the calculations, people were six times more likely to buy memorable if they found six than if they found 24 than if they found 24.
Well, deciding that we don't buy members probably -- it's probably good to preserve the line, but it turns out that the problem of risk of choice affects us in good decisions.
We decided not to decide, even though this doesn't get us.
Now the theme of the day, the financial saving.
I'm going to describe a study that I did with Garden Hudship, Emily Kamma and Weigh Janey, where we looked at the decisions on savings for about a million Americans, from about 65 plans of this country.
We were interested in seeing if the number of funds available in planners of savings of subjective savings for retirement.
And we found out that there was actually a correlation there.
We had 65 plans that went from two to 59 different options.
We found that the bigger the number of funding funds, there was less participation.
So if we look at the ends, we see that in the plans that offer two funds, the rate of participation was 70 percent or more, not as high as you wanted.
And in the plans that took about 60 funds, the rate of participation went down to the 60 percent.
It turns out that even if you decide to participate, when there are more choices, even in that case, there are negative consequences.
So for those who decided to participate, the bigger the number of choices, the more people were unable to avoid the actions or the investment funds.
The way there were more options, they were more willing to invest in financial account.
But none of these extreme decisions are the ones that we will recommend to optimize future financial well-being.
In the previous decade we've seen three main negative consequences to offer more and more possibilities.
The most likely thing is that they put the decision, that they apply it even when it goes against the self-interest.
It's more likely to make the worst decisions -- in finance, and health.
They are more likely to choose less satisfying things, even though it obviously gets better.
The main reason is that we have to look at that gigantic variety of malaria, mustard and minimum, but we are not able to do the calculations to compare and go and choose and choose from that awesome.
Today I want to propose to you today four simple techniques that we've tried, in one way or another, in different research, so that they can test in their business.
The first is, Court.
You've heard before, but it's never been more true than today, which is more.
People are always annoyed when I say, "Do you cut."
They care about losing space in the analysis.
But actually, what we're looking at more and more is that if you decide to cut, get rid of strange reproductive choices, there will be an increase in sales. You will go down the costs, there'll be a better experience in choice.
When Process & Gamble went from 26 different types of Health & Shakes to 15, you saw a 10 percent increase in sales.
When the color Goldman Nature eliminated the products for cats that are less sold -- they increased the uses in percent, for two causes, higher sales and lower costs.
You know that today's supermarkets, in average offers 45,000 products.
In a shop of Walmart they offered about 100,000 products.
But the ninth largest store in the world today is Avide and offering only 1,400 products -- a kind of satellite tomato salt.
In the world of financial savings -- I think one of the best examples that have emerged about how to manage the choices is David Lawrence plan, the Harvard program.
So all the Harvard employees are automatically incorporated to a life insurance background.
The people who really want to choose, are offered 20 funds, not 300 or more.
You know, often people say, "I don't know how to cut up.
They're all important choices.
The first thing I do is ask the employees, "Give me the differences that are between those options.
And if your employees can't difference, you will not do your customers either.
This afternoon, before I started this session, I was talking to Garden.
He told me that I would be willing to offer people in this audience a few holidays with all paid to the world's most beautiful road.
Here, a description here.
I want you to read it.
I'm going to leave a few seconds to read it, and then I want you to give you an applause if you're ready to take the Garden offer.
(And applied." Okay. Anyone who is ready to accept the supply.
They're not else?
Well, I'm going to show you something else.
You knew there was a trick.
Who is ready for that journey?
I think it actually came to hear more hands.
All right.
In fact, you had more information in the first round, than in the second, but I can go back and say that they thought the second time was more real.
Because images made it more real.
This leads me to the second technique to handle the problem of the decision-making operation.
And so people understand the differences between choices, they have to understand the consequences of each choice, and that the consequences must feel very vibrating, very cool.
Why are people spending 15 to 30 percent more in average when they use debit cards or credit cards than when they use definition cards or credit.
Because it doesn't seem real money.
It turns out that making it look more real, it can be a very positive tool for people to save more.
We did a study with Shakespeare British and Alexander Prine, on the staff of NGO who were working in India, these people were in a meeting where they were feeding a 4014 plan.
At that meeting, we built exactly how we used it, we made a little addition.
What we added was that we applied to the staff who would think about positive things that would happen in their lives if they save more money.
With this minute there was an increased increase in 20 percent and an increase in how much they were interested in saving or what they wanted to put in their savings accounts for four percent.
The third technique is Clashing.
We can handle more categories than options.
For example, this is a study we did in a magazine hall.
We saw that in the Western supermarkets throughout the edge of the north, the magazine exhibition can contain from 330 different kinds of different types to 6014.
But, you know?
Because climate tells me how to tell them.
These are two exhibitions of jewelry.
One is called Jack and the other, "Shake."
If you think the one on the left is Swink, and the one on the right is Jack, you get a pandemic.
(Players applied." Well, there's some of them.
If you think the one on the left is Jack and the one on the right is Swink, you get a pandemic.
Well, something else.
It turns out it's right.
The one on the left is Jack and the one on the right is Swink. But you know something?
This rating scheme is totally useless.
The categories must indicate something to who they choose -- not that they define them.
You often see this problem with those huge lists of background.
Who are they informed?
My fourth category: contributing complexity.
It turns out that we can drive a lot more information than we think, if we just simplify it a little bit.
We need to increase complexity.
I'm going to show you an example of what I mean.
Let's see a very complicated decision -- the purchase of a car.
This is a German manufacturer of cars that allows you to personalize it.
You have to take 60 decisions, to build the car.
And these decisions vary in the number of choices that are offering each one.
Colors, outside of the car. I have 56 possibilities.
Motorcycle, change box, four options.
What I'm going to do is to vary the order where decisions appear.
So half of the customers are going to go from many choices, 56 colors, a few boxes.
The other half of the customers are going to go from a few choices, four boxes, to 56 colors, many options.
And what am I going to see?
How involved you are.
If you are always accessible to the defect button in every decision, this indicates you're overwhelmed or it is, you're losing them.
We found that those who are going from many choices in a few choices -- they have the button button over and over again, and another more.
We lose them.
If you go from a few choices to many, you continue there.
Same information, the same number of options.
The only thing I did was disrupt the order where information is presented.
If we start with the easy, you learn to choose it.
Even though the box of changes is not saying anything about the preferences of inner decoration, in all ways we would prepare to choose it.
We are really excited about a product that we're building that now has more engaged with the process.
To sum up.
I've talked about four techniques to mitigate the problem of the choice: cut, eliminate strange alternatives -- concerned, making it real. Changing, we can manage more categories with fewer options, contributing complexity.
All of these techniques that I've presented to you were designed to help manage the alternatives or better, to use them in their issues, or for the people who serve them.
It's that I think the key to get the best of an election is being careful to choose it.
And the more careful we are in our best choices we can practice the art of choice.
Thank you very much.
In the 1980s, in the communist East Germany, if you had a writing machine should register it before the government.
You had to record an example of an example written with the machine.
And this is why the government could trace the origin of text.
If you found a writer with the wrong message you could trace the footprint to the origin of the idea.
In the West, we don't think anybody could do this, how much that this would limit freedom of expression.
We would never do that in our countries.
But today, in 2011, if you buy a laser color printer of any big manufacturer and print a page, that page will end up having some printed yellow dots on every page that make a pattern that makes them own from one and their printer.
That's happening today.
And nobody seems to get a lot about this.
This is an example of the ways that our governments use technology against us, the citizens.
And it's one of the three main causes of problems on the network.
If you look at what happens in the online world, we can fix the attacks according to their attacks.
There are three main groups.
They are the cybers.
Like Mr. Dimitri Guildin's Golden City in Ukraine.
The cylinder cell phone is very easy to understand.
These guys make money.
They use the cybercriminals to earn a lot of money, some amounts of stuff.
There are really many cases of millions online, multiplications, who earn money with their attacks.
This is Like Leonardo Tessan, from Mars, State.
This is Alfred Gong.
This is Stephen Watson.
This is Bronx South Bar.
These are Matthew Anderson Anderson, Arab Star etc., etc., etc.
These guys make their fortunes online, but they do it by illegal media through banking tricks to steal money from our accounts when we buy online, or steal our keys to get information from our cards when we buy in an infected computer.
The secret service of America, two months ago, frozen the Swiss account of this gentlemen, Sam Jane, and this story had 14 million dollars when it was frozen.
Mr. Jane standing up -- he was known his paradise.
And I say today is more likely to be a victim of a crime that is a real crime.
And it's very obvious that this goes from bad at worst.
In the future, most crimes will happen online.
The second group of attacks in importance that we see today is not motivated by money.
There's another thing that moves them, they motivate them, they motivate them, they motivate the laughter.
groups like Anonymous have described in the last 12 months by occupying a role in the online attacks.
Those are the three main attacks: criminals who do it for money, hackers like Anonymous who do it to protect and the last group are the national states that they attack.
And then we see cases like Diginisting.
That's a good example of government attacks against its own citizens.
Digital is a characteristic authority of the Netherlands, or, actually, it was.
Decline was the last fall.
They were supporting the safety of the site and they punched a cybercriminal.
Last week I asked, in a meeting with the Dutch government, I asked one of the leaders if they found the death of people because of the attack to Digital.
And the answer of him was yes.
So how do people die from an attack of these?
Digital is a certified authority.
They sell certified.
What are the creatures serve for?
Well, you need if you have a website with attacks, including SLASS, services like Ghem.
Except that they will intercept a foreign critical authority.
They emit characteristics creative.
And in the case of Dickinson exactly that.
And what happened in the Arab Spring, and those things that have happened, for example, in Egypt.
Well, in Egypt, the protesters took up the headquarters of secret Egyptian police in April 2011, and during the course of the building, they found many papers.
Among those papers was this cardiac titled "Firefire."
And within that folder there were notes from a company with self-design in Germany that had sold the Egyptian government to intercept the communications of the citizens of the country.
They had sold this tool by 280,000 euros to the Egyptian government.
The company is right here.
So, Western governments provide tools to totalitarian governments to do this to their citizens.
But Western governments are also doing this to themselves.
For example, in Germany, just a couple of weeks ago, the Scitation traffic was found -- a traffic used by German government officials to investigate their own citizens.
If you're suspicious in a criminal case, it's pretty obvious that your phone is interconnected.
But today it goes further.
The Internet connection.
They will use even tools like the Scitation traffic to infect our computer with a trauma to allow them to see all the communication, and listen to the online discussions to get our data.
When we think about things like this obvious answer should be "Well, it looks bad, but I don't really affect me because I'm an honest citizen.
Why would you care?
I have nothing to hide.
And that argument doesn't make sense.
It's in play.
Privacy is not dispute.
It's not a matter of privacy against security.
It's about freedom against control.
If we could rely on our governments today, in 2011, any right that we demand today, will be forever.
Will we blind in any future government, in an administration that we could have within 50 years?
These are the questions that you have to worry about in the next 50 years.
This is where I live. I live in Kenya, in the south part of Nairobi National Park.
These are the cows of my dad in the background, and behind the cow, the Nairobi National Park.
The Nairobi National Park has no close to the most part of the south, which means that wild animals like the cells migrate freely out of the park.
And predators, like lions and follow them, and this is what they do.
They kill our cattle.
This is one of the ones that killed at night, and so soon we woke up in the morning, and we found it dead in the morning, because it was the only tone we had.
My community, the masses, we think we came from the sky with our animals and all the land to preserve them, and so we value them so much.
So I grew up holding the lions.
More people are warriors that protect our community and livestock and they're also upset with the problem.
So they kill lions.
This is one of six lions that killed in Nairobi.
I think that's why there are so few in Nairobi National Park.
A child in my community, from six to nine years old, is responsible for his father and this was the same thing that happened to me.
So I had to find a way to solve this problem.
My first idea was to use fire, because I thought the lions gave them fear.
But I realized that this doesn't actually be serious, because even helped the lions look at the study of far.
I didn't get back. I kept going.
A second idea was to use a steeping.
I tried to deceive the lions so they would think I was near the style.
But lions are very smart.  They came the first day, and they saw the speakers, and they went out, but the second day, they came back and said, "This thing doesn't move, it's always here.  So they jumped and killed animals.
So one night I was walking around the lab with a torch and that day, the lions didn't come.
I discovered that lions are afraid of light that is moving.
So I had an idea.
And I got a switch that I would ask and turn the lights.
And this is a little lamp of a broken line.
I love everything.
As you can see, the solar panel charges the battery and the battery supply electricity to the little Indian box, I call it a transformation.
And the Indian box makes the lights develop.
As you can see, the light bulb lights out there, because that's where the lions come from.
And that's how you see it when you come at night.
The lights develop and send the lions to think that I'm walking through the stomach, but I'm sleeping in my bed.
Thank you.
So I put them in my house two years ago, and since then, we never had trouble with lions.
And the homes of the neighborhood heard the idea.
One of them is from this grandmother.
She had killed a lot of animals and asked me if he could put the lights.
I said yes.
I put them up. You can see the background, these are the lions for lions.
Since then, I've installed them in seven houses in my community, and they're serving a lot.
And my idea is also used now by Kenya, to scare other predators, like heads, legal, and it's also being used to scan elephants from the farms.
Thanks to this invention, I was fortunate to get a scholarship in one of the best schools in Kenya, British International School, and I'm very excited.
My new school is now helping raise funding and awareness.
I even led my friends to my community, and we installed lights in the houses that they don't have, and I teach them how to put them on.
So a year ago, I was just a child on the sides of the savanna putting the cows of my father, and I used to see airplanes flying up, and he told me that someday would be within one.
And here I am.
I got the opportunity to come in plane for the first time at TED.
My big dream is to become an engineer of aviation and pilot when you grow.
I used to hate the lions, but now as my invention is saving the cows of my dad and the lions, we can be with lions without any conflict.
So what in my language means, thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You don't imagine how exciting it is to hear a story like yours.
So you got a scholarship -- Richard Turkey: Yeah.
CA: You're working on other electrical inventions.
What's the next on your list?
RL: My next invention is -- I want to make a close electric -- CA: A close electrical?
RL: I know that they were already invented by the close electric ones, but I want to do mine.
CA: So I tried it once, right? And you -- RIS: I've tried it before, but I stopped because I got a called --  CA: On the foot of the Canyon, Richard Turkey, you're a big thing.
We're going to get in every step that you go, my friend.
Thank you very much. RI: Thank you very much.
When I was little, I thought my country was the best on the planet.
And I grew up singing a song called "No Invisible "Not Index."
And I felt very proud.
In school, we spent all the time studying the story of Kim Shirewhow, but we never learned a lot about the rest of the world, except America, South Korea, Japan are the enemies.
Even though I sometimes wondered about the rest of the world, I thought I would spend my whole life in North Korea, until everything changed all of a sudden everything changed.
When I was seven years old, I saw my first public execution.
But I thought my life in North Korea was normal.
My family was not poor and myself had never happened.
But one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter from my sister.
He said, "When you read this, the five members of the family will stop exist in this world, because we haven't eaten in the last two weeks.
We're collected together on the floor, and our bodies are so weak. We're ready to die."
I was very stuck.
It was the first time I heard that people were suffering in my country.
At the time, when I walked in front of the train station, I saw something terrible I can't erase from my memory.
A life without life was dead on the street, holding a little boy in his arms looking at his mother's face without being able to do anything.
No one helped them, because they were very concerned about taking care of them and their families.
A huge famine in North Korea in the middle of the 1990s.
At the end, over a million North Koreans died during the famine and only few people survived eating past, insects and tree cortex.
They were also made more and more frequently the energy short, all around me was completely dark at night except for the lights of the sea in China, barely crossing the river from my house.
I always asked me why they had light and we don't.
This is a satellite picture of North Korea at night compared to the neighboring countries.
This is the Mom River, which serves of limit between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very anticipated in certain points, allowing Koreans to grow secret.
But many die.
Sometimes, I saw bodies floating in the river.
I can't reveal the details of how I came out of North Korea, but I can only say that during the years of the famine I was sent to China to live with distant patients.
But I just thought I'd be separated from my family for short time.
I could never have imagined that I would take 14 years to live together.
In China, it was hard to live like a young woman without my family.
I had no idea what life would be like as a normal reform.
But soon I learned that it's not just extremely difficult, but also dangerous, because the North refugees in China were considered illegal immigrants in China.
So I was living with a constant fear that my identity was revealed, and it would be replaced to a horrible destination back in North Korea.
One day, my worst nightmare became reality, when I was arrested by the Chinese police and introduced me in the police station.
Someone had accused me for being Norway, then they tested my skills in Chinese language and asked me a lot of questions.
I was terrified.
I thought my heart was going to explode.
If it didn't seem natural, it could be incarcerated and depressed.
I thought my life was going to end.
But I managed to control my emotions and answer the questions.
At the end of the interrogation. One official said to another, "This was a fake record. She's not north."
And they let me go. It was a miracle.
Some North Koreans are looking for asylum.
But a lot of them can be arrested by Chinese police and department.
These women were very lucky.
Even though they had caught them, they were eventually released after a harsh international pressure.
These Koreans didn't have so much luck.
Every year, North Koreans are captured in China and sports to North Korea, where they're tortured or crazy or executed in public.
Even though I was lucky to escape, many other Koreans have not been so lucky.
It's tragic that the Koreans have to hide their identities and fight so hard just to survive.
Even after learning a new language and finding work, all of its world can be abused in a second.
That's why after 10 years of hiding my identity, I decided I decided to risk the South Korea.
And I started a new life again.
In South Korea was a much bigger challenge than I was expected.
The English was very important in South Korea, I had to start learning my third language.
Also, I understood that there was a great gap between North and South America.
We're all Korea, but in the inside, we have come to be very different because of 67 years of divide.
Even a crisis of identity.
Am I survival or Norden?
Where am I? Who am I?
Suddenly, there was no country that I could call with pride mine.
Although I adapted to the life in South Korea it wasn't easy, I made a plan. I started studying for the increase of income to college.
Just when I started adopting my new life, I got a call all the time.
North Korean authorities played some money that sent my family, and, as a punishment -- my family was going to be displaced to force the force to a distant location on the outside.
They had to run immediately.
So I started planning how to help them escape.
The Koreans have to travel long distances on the way to freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Korea.
So, ironically, I took a flight to China and fell into the border with North Korea.
Since my family couldn't speak Chinese -- I had to guide them, somehow for over 3,000 miles across China and then through the South Asia.
The journey in bus took a week, and we almost were caught several times.
Once, our bus was arrested and addressed by a Chinese police officer.
And he asked the identification of everybody, and he started asking them questions.
As my family couldn't understand Chinese, I thought my family was going to be arrested.
When the Chinese officer came up to my family, he was mostly standing and told him that they were source people who were sharing.
He looked at me suspectively, but fortunately he believed me.
We did all the way to the Lorden border.
But I had to spend almost all my money to bribe the border guards in Laws.
But even after I spent the border, my family was arrested and imprisoned to cross the border illegal frontier.
After paying tickets and bones, my family was released in a month.
But in time, my family was arrested and incarcerated again in the Lapatry capital.
This was one of the lowest points in my life.
I did everything to liberate my family, and we were so close, but my family was held in prison prison from the South Korean embassy embassy.
I went and came between the immigration office and the police station, desperately trying to liberate my family.
But I didn't have enough money to pay more bribe or multiple.
I lost hope.
At that time, or the voice of a man asking, "What is the problem?
I was so surprised that a stranger would care about question.
With my poor English and a dictionary, I explained the situation, and without doubt the man went to the ATM and gave me the rest of my money for my family and for two other Koreans and taking them out of prison.
I thank him with all my heart, and I said, "Why do I help me?
"I'm not helping you."
"I'm helping the Norwegian town.
I realized that that was a symbolic moment in my life.
The amazing unknown symbolizes a new hope for me and for the Korean town when we needed it.
And I showed that the kindness of the unknown and the support of the international community are really the jobs of hope that the North people need.
Over time, after our long journey, my family and I met in South Korea.
It's just half the battle.
Many Koreans are separated from their families, and when they go to a new country, they start with little or no money.
So we can benefit from the international community with education, English language, work practice, and more.
We can also act as a bridge between people in North Korea and the rest of the world.
Because many of us continue in contact with families still inside, and we send information and money that is helping change North Korea from within.
I've been very lucky, I have received a lot of help and inspiration in my life, so I want to help the Koreans an opportunity to thrive with international support.
I'm sure you're going to see more and more Koreans going around the world, including on the TED stage.
Thank you.
I live in Central Africa.
This is Center South Center, signs of little food, fast landscapes, based out.
So the city planners came together, and they thought, we're going to change the name of Center South to represent something else, so they changed the South Angeles, as if this would fix what's actually wrong in the city.
This is Los Angeles South Los Angeles --  shops, fast food, bar land.
Like 265,000 other Americans, I live in a food desert, the Los Angeles Center, home of food places to take and eat in the car.
The curious thing is that the food places to make kill more people than the food in the car.
People are dying from rural diseases in Los Angeles.
For example, the obesity rate in my neighborhood is five times larger than, say, Beverly Hillis, that's like 15 miles away.
I care about seeing that this happens.
And I ask myself, how would you feel if you didn't have access to healthy food, and if every time you go out of house you see the day effects that the current food system has in their neighborhood?
I see cancer chairs bought and sold as used cars.
I see centers of lung dinosaurs like Starbucks.
And I think this must stop.
I think the problem is solution.
Food is the problem, and it's the solution.
In addition to me in addition to 45 minutes of elbow and back to buy an apple that has no pesticides, it doesn't have persuasions.
What I did, I was planting a food forest in front of my house.
In a land fragment we call a graduation.
It's 45 feet wide.
The point is, it belongs to the city.
But you have to keep it.
I said, "Well, I can do what I come in my head, because it's my responsibility and I have to keep it."
That's how I decided to keep it.
So my group and I, L.A. Green Gramms, we got together and we started planting our food forest -- frustrating trees -- you know, the nine full vegetables.
What we do, we are kind of a kind of a paradigm paid by heartbreaking out of all the procedures of all the procedures and all of the completely voluntary city, and everything we do is free.
And the garden was beautiful.
And then someone complained out.
The city came up with me and in summary, they gave me a cartoon saying that I had to remove my garden -- the circular was made court order.
And I said, "Come on, right?
A judicial order for planting food on a piece of land that nobody matters?  So I was like, "Well, get it."
Because this time it wasn't going to happen.
L.A. Times had the story written by Steve Louis, and I talked to the conflict and one of the members of Green Grudges, who put a petition in Channiel, with 900 signatures, we were a success.
We had the victory in our hands.
My conflict even called to say that they responded and taken what we were doing.
I mean, why not?
L.A. is the U.S. city with more based terrain.
It has six miles of bar terrain.
That equals 20 Central Paris.
That's enough space to plant 52 million plants.
Why do they don't look good at this?
It's going to grow a plant to give a few thousand seeds.
When a dollar of hate will give you 75 dollars of output.
It's my man, when I tell people, crops your own food.
Building your own food is like printing your own money.
You see, I have a legacy for Central Canada.
I grew up there. I grew my kids there.
I refuse to be part of this manufacturing reality that was manufactured to me for others, and I'm going to manufacture my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
The garden is my graffiti -- I grow my art.
Like an artist of graffiti who emerges walls, I broke soils, gardens.
I use the garden, the land, like a piece of canvas, and plants and trees, are my emergency of that canvas.
You would be surprised to see what land can do, if they let it be their canvas.
You simply can't imagine how amazing a sunflower is and how it affects people.
What happened?
I'm a witness of how my garden became an educational tool, transformation of my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of land.
We are the land.
You would be surprised to see how you affect children.
The garden is the most therapeutic and critical act that you can do, especially in a threshold.
Also, they get frankly.
I remember a occasion, who came a mother and his daughter, they were like 1936 at night and they were in my garden. I went out and looked very quickly.
I, well, man, I felt bad that they were there, and I said, you know, you don't have to do this.
This is on the street for a reason.
I felt shame by seeing people who were so close to me with hungry, and this just reinforces why I do this, people ask me, "Well, don't you feel that people are going to steal your food?
I say, "Oh my God, I'm not afraid you're going to steal it."
So that's the street.
That's what it is about.
I want you to take it, but at your time, I want you to challenge your health.
There was another time that I put a garden in a refugee shelter at the center of Los Angeles.
They were these guys, who helped me download the truck.
It was fabulous. I was shared by their stories about how this had affected them and how they used to plant with their mom and his grandmother, and it was fabulous to see how this changed them, so it was just just for a moment.
So Green Groupes have reached maybe 20 gardens.
We've had about 50 people who come from, work and participate, all in volunteer plan.
If kids grow color, kids eat color.
If you grow tomatoes to eat tomatoes --  But if none of this is taught you, if you don't teach them how food affects your mind and body, you eat blind what you put in front of them.
I see young people who want to work, but they have this thing that they're trapped in. I see color kids that are on this way designed for them, which doesn't take them anywhere.
With the gardening, I see an opportunity where we can train these kids who are getting rid of their communities to have a sustainable life.
And when we do this, who knows?
Maybe the next George Washington Carron.
But if we don't change the composition of the Earth, we will never do it.
Now this is one of my plans. This is something I want to do.
I want to plant a whole block of gardens, where people can share food in the same square.
I want to take containers and turn them into healthy coffee.
Don't get me wrong.
I'm not talking about free things, because free is not sustainable.
The curious thing about sustainability, you have to sustain it.
What I'm talking about is to put people to work on the street, take kids out of the street, who know the joy, the pride and honor of growing their own food, opening farmers of farmers.
What I want to do here, we have to make it sexy.
I want you all to become an electrochemical renewable, you know, they have the grassroots groups.
We have to change the script of what a look like.
If you're not a graduate, you're not a show.
What are you going to take you to take your tail right?
That is your choice.
In size, if you want to meet me, well, if you want to see me, you don't call me if you want to sit in comfortable chairs and have meetings to talk about doing some shit -- to talk about doing some shit.
If you want to see me, come to the garden with your room so that we can plant something.
Peace peace. Thank you.
Thank you.
(Spines of March."  (Profile noises)  You probably all agree with me that this is a very nice road.
It's made of asphalt and asphalt is a good material to drive, but not always, especially not in days like today, which is a lot.
You can have a lot of water in the asphalt that I salute in.
And especially if you go into your bike and these cars pass on, that's not very nice.
Also, the asphalt can make a lot of noise.
It's a noisy material, and if we build roads, like in the Netherlands, very close to cities, we would want a quiet road.
The solution for that is to make perfect asphalt roads.
Portuguest asphalt -- a material that we use now in most of the roads of the Netherlands, has dogs and water can go through it, so all the rainwater flowing up to the sides and will have a road that is easy to drive, and they won't jump to water anymore.
Noise also disappears in these pores as well.
Because it's very hurt, all the noise will disappear -- so it's a very quiet road.
It also has destiny, of course, and the disadvantage of this road is that you can get rid of it.
What is it to be disappeared? Look at this road, the stones of the surface come out.
First of all, then a few more and more and more, etc., and then -- well, I'm not going to do that.  But you can give it your windshield and you're not happy with that.
And finally, this can also lead to more and more damage.
Sometimes you can create backs with that.
Oh, there.
Bachester, of course, that you can become a problem, but we have a solution.
And you can actually see how the damage appears in this material.
It's a porous asphalt as I said, so it's just a little amount of advantage between the stones.
Because of the experiment, the ultraviolet light, to the oxygen, the advance, this bit of block, the glue between the rides, it will conclude, and if you plug it up, you will make microscopes and will separate from the administrators.
So if you drive down the road, you will take your add -- as we saw it here.
To solve this problem, we think of restriction materials.
If we can make this material share, then we probably have a solution.
So what we can do is use steel wool from that to clean sadness, and we can cut steel wool into very small pieces, and we can mix those little bits with the Benting.
So we have asphalt with little bits of steel sleep on it.
Then you need a machine, like the one you see here, that you use to cook -- a indication machine.
Democracy can heat down, especially steel, is very good at that.
So what you need to do is heat the steel, melt the Benting, the band flow through these microscopes and the stones will look back at the surface.
Today I use a microwave oven, because I can't bring the big computer machine here on the stage.
Micro-control mortality is a similar system.
I put the sample, which I'm now going to take to see what happened.
This is the sample that comes out now.
I said we have this kind of industrial machine in the lab to heat the samples.
We tried a lot of samples there, and then the government, they really saw our results, and they thought, "Well, that's very interesting. We have to try it."
So they gave us a piece of roads, 400 meters from the HIV highway, where we had to do a trial lane to test this material.
So that's what we did there. You see where we were doing the test in roads, and then, of course, this road will last several years without any damage. That's what we know about practice.
We took a lot of samples from this road, and we tested them in the lab.
We made the samples older, we put a lot of payload in them, we repair them then with our manufacturing machine, and we repair them and try them again.
We can repeat this many times.
Well, to conclude, I can say that we've made a material using steel fibers -- incorporating these fibers, using the energy of industrialization to actually increase the lives of the surface of the road, even they can double the life of the surface -- it really will save a lot of money with very simple tricks.
And now, of course, you have curiosity.
We still have the show here. It's pretty hot.
In fact, you have to face first before you can show you how you act your reputation.
But I'm going to do a try.
Let's see. Yes, it worked.
Thank you.
When I was 11 years old, I remember having woken up a morning with the sound of the board in my house.
My father was listening to BBC News, in his little gray radio.
He had a great smile in his face that was unusual in those times, because news usually depressed.
"The Taliban were out -- I scream my father.
I didn't know what it meant, but I could see that my father was very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a real school, he said.
A morning I'll never forget.
True school.
You see, I was six years old when the Taliban were gripped from Afghanistan and made illegal that girls went to school.
For the next five years, I was dressed as a child to escort my older sister who could no longer be out there, to go to a secret school.
It was the only way that we could educate them.
Every day, we took a different route so nobody could support where we were.
We had to hide books in market bags so that it would seem to be shopping.
The school was in a house, over 100 of us stuck in a small room.
It was nice in the winter, but extremely hot.
We all knew we risk our lives, the teacher, the students and our parents.
Every once in a while, the school suddenly closed for a week, because the Taliban were suspicious.
We always wondered what they knew about us.
Were they following us?
Did you know where we live?
We were attached, but still, the school was where we wanted to be.
I was very lucky to grow in a family where education was appreciated and the daughters a dream.
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time.
A total incomplete from a remote provider of Afghanistan, insisted that his daughter, my mother, went to school, and so his father was able to put it.
But my educated mother became a teacher.
This is it.
It's going to retire two years ago, just to convert our house in school for girls and women from our neighborhood.
And my father, this is, was the first of all his family to get education.
There was no doubt that his children had to receive education, even their daughters, despite the Taliban.
For him, there was a bigger risk to not educate his children.
Over the years of the Taliban I remember that there were times when I was very frustrated by our life, and I was always scared and didn't see a future.
I wanted to return, but my father said, "Hey, daughter me, you can lose everything you have in life.
They can steal your money. You can force your house during a war.
But there's one thing that will always be with you, what is here and if we have to sell our blood to pay your education, we'll do it.
So you still want not to continue?
I'm 22 years old.
I grew up in a country that has been destroyed for decades of war.
Less than six percent.
Instead, I find myself proud to graduate in Miract College in change.
When I went back to Afghanistan, my grandfather, which was exhibiting his home for the courage of educating his daughters, was one of the first ones to be happy.
He is not just about my college degree, but also that I was the first woman, and I'm the first woman, I carry it through the streets of Kabul.
My family believes in me.
I dream big, but my family has even bigger dreams for me.
That's why I'm the global embassy of 1018, a global campaign to educate women.
That's why I cofounded SOLA, the first and perhaps the only private school for girls in Afghanistan, a country that is still risky for girls going to school.
The exciting thing is I see the students in my school with the strong desire to harness the opportunity.
And I see their parents and their families who, like mine, admire for them, to weigh and still face a daunting opposition.
Like Amy -- it's not his real name, and I can't show you your face, but Ahmed is the father of one of my students.
Less than a month ago, he and his daughter went out of SOLA to his village, and literally they escaped from being killed by a bomb on the way, for minutes.
When you get to your house, you are the phone, a voice warned that if you kept sending your daughter to school, you would try it again.
"Let me leave you, if you like, "But not harm the future of my daughter for his old and reduced ideas.
What I've been aware of from Afghanistan, and it's something that is often forgotten in the West, is that behind most of the people who we succeed, there's a father who recognized the value of his daughter and he sees that the success of her own success.
It doesn't mean that our mothers have not been key in our success.
In fact, they are often the first compelling interests of their daughters, but in the context of a society like Afghanistan, we need the support of men.
Under the Taliban.
But today, over three million girls go to school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan looks so different from here in America.
I find that Americans see the fragility of changes.
I fear these changes don't last much, after the U.S. troops.
But when I go back to Afghanistan, when I see the students in my school and their parents who are advocating for them, that the animals, I see a future promise and a lasting change.
For me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and unlimited possibilities, and every day the SOLA girls remember me.
Like me, they dream big.
Thank you.
I've never forgotten the words of my grandmother who died in the existence, daughter, resistance to Gaddard. He struggled against him.
But you never come back a reporter stuff Gaddar."
They've spent almost two years since the liberal revolution inspired by the vast mass of mass movements as much as the Egyptian revolution.
A forces with a lot of other online citizens, inside and outside of the country to call a day of force and initiate a revolution against the strange regime.
And we succeeded. It was a big revolution.
Women and young books were in the savanna, demanding the fall of the regime, and putting up freedom of freedom, dignity and social justice.
They've shown a value to be able to face the brutal dictator of Gaddina.
They've shown a great sense of solidarity from the East East, to the west, to the south.
Finally, after a period of six months of brutal war and some loss of about 50,000 dead, we managed to release our country and defeat the ground.
However, Gaddafi left a heavy burden -- a land legacy and corruption and seating seeds.
For four decades, the strange regime of Gaddafi, destroyed infrastructure and culture and moral structure of liberal society.
aware of the devastation and the challenges, I've wanted, along with many other women, rebuild civil civil society, demanding an inclusive transition and fair to democracy and national reconciliation.
They were set up about 200 organizations in Beijing during and immediately after the fall of Gaddafi, about 300 in Trillion.
After a 33 year-old period, I went back to Libya and with unique enthusiasm -- I started organizing workshops about developing capabilities and leadership skills.
With an incredible group of women, we founded the World War Plator for peace, a movement of women, leaders, very diverse orientation, to advocate for the social autonomy of women and our right of equal participation in building democracy and peace.
I found myself with a very difficult environment in the prefrontal period, an environment that was increasingly polarized, which is moving from the selfish policies of domination and exclusion.
Over time, our initiative was approved and successful.
Women won a 17th of the National Congress in the first elections in 52 years.
However, gradually the power of elections and revolution as a whole, were disappearing, every day we found news news.
One day we woke up with the news of ancient mosques and subjects subject.
Another day I loved with the news of the American ambassador, and the attack to the control.
Another day we wake up with the news of the army officers of the army.
And every day, every day we wake up with the government of the military and their continents of human rights and their lack of respect of law.
Our society, formed by a revolutionary mindset, is more polarizing more, and it's taken away from the ideals and principles of freedom, dignity, social justice, that we had at the beginning.
It's intolerance, exclusion and revenge.
I'm not here today at all to inspire our story of the success of criminal "slow and elections.
Rather, I'm here today to confess that we, as a nation, we choose wrong, we make the wrong decision.
We don't prioritize well.
Because elections didn't bring peace and stability and security to Liberia.
The creative list and the alternative between candidates and candidates brought peace and national reconciliation?
No, they didn't.
What happened then?
Why is our society still polarized and dominated with selfish police policies and exclusion, so much for men like women?
Maybe what was missing wasn't just women, but the female values of compassion, missionary and inclusion values.
Our society needs national dialogue and creation of consensus more than the elections, which only reinforce polarization and divide.
Our nation needs the qualitative representation of the female more than need the numerical and quantitative representation of it.
We need to stop acting like inkjet agents and calling days of anger.
We need to start acting as compassion and mercy.
We have to develop a female discourse that not only honor but also put in practice instead of revenge. collaboration instead of competition, income instead of exclusion.
These are the ideals that a Libya, destroyed by war, needs desperately to get peace.
Because peace has an algorithm that is about interaction and alternative between female perspective and male perspective.
That's the real creativity.
We need to establish that in an existential way before we do it in a social form.
According to a version of the Koran "Sam, peace is the word of the missionary God, "fooling compassion."
At the same time, the word "One: which is known in all adjacent traditions, has the same root in Arabic that the word "adaptity: symbolic the female and material, which will go through all the humanity that men and women, which all the tribes and all the people have emerged.
And so just like the uterus covers completely the embryo, which grows inside the divine matrix of compassion all the existence.
So we say, "My mission would get all the things.
That's how we say, "My mistake press about my idea."
That everybody is given the grace of mercy.
Thank you.
I'm here today to talk to you about an unusual question, which has an equally incontented response.
It's about the secrets of domestic violence, and the question I'm going to address is the one that everybody always do: Why is she left?
Why would anybody stay with a man who was painted?
I'm not a psychiatrist, no social worker, no experience in domestic violence.
I'm just a woman with a story to tell.
I was 22 years old. I had just met at Harvard University.
I had moved to New York for my first job as a writer and editor in the Senior magazine.
I had my first apartment, my first green card.
My secret was that many, many times, the man, that I created my twin soul, I was telling her head with a gun.
The man, which I loved more than anyone in this world, put a gun in my head and threats to kill me more times than I can remember.
I'm here to tell you the story of "Locality love -- a psychological trap of love, where every year millions of women, and even some men.
It could even be his story.
I don't look like a typical survival of domestic violence.
I'm licensed in the University of Harvard and I have a MBA in March in March Business School.
I've spent most of my career working for companies of the little Fortune 500 list, between those Johnson & Johnson, Leo Burgevilla's and The Washington Post.
I take almost 20 years married with my second husband, and we have three children.
My dog is a black laboratory and driving a minister Honor Obergy.
So my first message for you is that domestic violence can happen to anyone, all races, all the religions, all the levels of performance and education.
It's everywhere.
And my second message is that everyone thinks that domestic violence happens to women, which is a women's problem.
Not exactly.
More than 85 percent of the tiles are men, and the domestic abuse only happens in intimate relationships and interrogating and long duration or said otherwise, in families, the last place we want or hope to find violence -- reasons why, the domestic abuse is so distributed.
I would have told you that it would be the last person in the world that was going to be with a man who stood up, and I was actually a very typical victim because of my age.
I was 22 years old, and in the United States, women in between 16 and 24 are three times more likely to be victims of domestic violence than the other ages, and over 500 women in that age are killed every year by partners, neighborhoods and abusive husbands in the United States.
I was also a typical victim because I didn't know anything about domestic violence, his warning signals or his patterns.
I met Congo in a cold, rainy night of January.
I was sitting beside my side at the New York subway and started floating with me.
He told me two things.
The first one was that he had just escaped from a University of the Albert Langua and he worked in a very important bank of Wall Street.
But what struck me the most in that first encounter was that it was smart, and it seemed like a boy of the field.
I had some big motors like apples and a storytelling strip, and it seemed so sweet.
One of the smartest things that Congo did, from the beginning, was to create the illusion that I was the dominant component of the partner.
He did it mostly at the beginning by putting it into a pen.
We started coming out and loved all of me, which was ready, that I had gone to Harvard, which was a passion to help teenage girls, and my job.
I wanted to know everything about my family, my childhood, my dreams and illusions.
Congo believed in me, as a writer and as a woman, as no one had ever done it.
And that's why the license in that prestigious school and the work in Wall Street and his bright future had so much relevance to him.
I didn't know that the first phase in any relationship of domestic violence is to be seduced and having the victim.
And I didn't know that the second step is to isolate it.
Now, the last thing I wanted to do was to take me from New York and leave my dreams, but I thought I had to make sacrifices for your partner, so I accepted my job and Congo and I went together with Manhattan.
I had no idea that I was falling in a local love: that I was getting from head into a physical trap and financial and psychological process.
The next step in the domestic violence pattern is to introduce the threat of violence to see how it reacts it.
And here is where they go into stage those pilots.
As soon as we moved to New England you already know, that site where Congo was supposed to be so safe to buy three pilots.
One had in the car gang.
Another one was taken under the pillow in our bed, and the third always in his pocket.
And he said that he needed those pilots because of the trauma that lived from small.
I needed them to feel safe.
But those pills actually were a message for me, and although I had never raised my hand, my life was already in serious danger, every minute every single day.
The first physical attack in Canada was five days before our wedding.
It was seven o'clock in the morning, and I still had the shirt.
Five days later, when the 10 bruises of my neck had disappeared, I put my mother's wedding suit, and I married him.
Despite what had happened, I was sure we would live happily forever, because I loved it, and he also wanted me a lot.
And I was very, very respected.
It simply had felt very accused by the wedding and the fact of forming a family with me.
I had been an isolated accident and never would make me harm.
I spent twice more in our honey moon.
And the first time I was driving up to a secret beach and lost, and he gave me so strong in the head that I drank several times against the convenient of the car.
And then, a couple of days later, driving back from our honey moon, I was sent by the traffic and threw a Big Mac cold to the face.
Congo kept giving him one or twice a week for the next two and a half years of our marriage.
I was wrong when I thought it was the only one in this situation.
One in three American women is a victim of domestic violence or academic violence at some point in their life, and the Center of Disease Control reported that every year 15 million children are massively, 15 million.
So actually, I had very good company.
Going back to my question: Why did I get it?
The answer is simple.
I didn't know that he was abusing me.
Instead, I was a very strong woman, fell in love with a profoundly integrated man -- and it was the only person in the world that could help Congo face their densers.
The other question that everybody does is, why does it simply not get married?
Why didn't I go? I could have gone at any time.
This is the most sad and painful question that people do, because we, the victims, we know something that you normally ignore -- it's incredibly dangerous to abandon a master.
Because the last phase in the domestic violence pattern is to kill it.
More than 70 percent of the killers in domestic violence cases occur after the victim has end the relationship, after they die, because then the abuse has no longer to lose.
Other repertoires include permanent academic, even after the abuse has gone back to married, financial resources, and manipulation of the family justice system to terrified the victim and their children, who normally are forced by judges to spend not supermarket with the man who paid their mother.
And we still ask wondering why it simply doesn't go?
I was able to go to me, because of one last paler station that I sold my denial.
I realized that the man who loved so much, would have killed me if he had allowed it.
So I broke the silence.
I told everyone the world to the police, to the police, to my friends, to my friends and family, and I'm here today because all of you helped me.
We have the tendency to strategy victims as fancy headlines, self-design women, dense goods.
The question, "Why is it left?
For some people it's a way to say, "The guilt is your because of standing -- as if victims will be able to deliberately choose to fall out of men who want to destroy us.
But since I published "Love Long: I've heard stories of stories of men and women who were also scanning, who learned an unusual lesson of what happened to them, and they react their lives joyful and happy lives as employees, husbands and mothers completely free of violence, like mine.
Because it turns out that I'm actually a victim and a very typical domestic violence survivor.
I went back to marry a man and a kind, and we have those three children.
I have that black laboratory and also that minister.
What I'm not going to have ever more, ever, is a carrier pilot pointing to my head in someone who says it wants me.
At this moment, as you're thinking, "Hey, that's fascinating, or "Hello, what touch it was, but all this time I've actually been talking about you.
I assure you that there are a few people who are listening to me right now, which are being held or that they were from small or absorbed themselves.
The male could be affecting his daughter, his sister, his best friend right now.
I was able to end my mad particular love by breaking the silence.
And I keep doing it today.
It's my way to help other victims, and it's my last request to you.
Talk about what you've heard here.
The abuse is only in silence.
They have the power to end the domestic violence just throwing light on it.
The victims need everybody.
We need each of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence.
They take the rain to the light talking about it with their children, their job partners, their friends and family.
They rethink their vision of survivors as fantastic and lovely people who have a full future.
They recognize the early signs of violence to connect consciously, to stop their climb and show the victims a safe path.
Together, we can turn our bed, our tables and our families in the safe and peaceful samples that should be.
Thank you.
Hi. I call me Cameron Russia, and for a while, I'm a model.
To be precise, for 10 years ago.
And I feel that at this moment there's an uncomfortable tension in the room because I shouldn't have been dressed like this.  Luckily, I've brought clothes to change.
This is the first laundry change on a TED stage, so you have a lot of luck to preserve it, I think.
If some of the women were horrified when they arrived, they don't have to do it now, but I will find it later on Twitter.
I also want to point out that I have the privilege of being able to change what you think about me in just 10 seconds.
Not everybody has that opportunity.
These caps are very uncomfortable -- less wrong than I don't have to use them.
The worst part is to pass this sweater through your head, because it's when you're going to laugh from me, so you don't do anything while you cover your head.
All right.
Why have I done this?
It's been embarrassing.
Well, I hope not as much as this picture.
The appearance is powerful, but it's also surface.
I've changed totally what they thought about me in six seconds.
And in this picture, I had never had a girlfriend in real life.
I was totally uncomfortable and the photographer told me that I would scratch the back, and it would take the hair out of the kid.
Of course, except for surgery or an artificial bone like the one that I made two days ago for work, there is very little we can do to transform our looks, which, even though shallow and immune, has a huge impact in our lives.
So today, to me, being brave means to be honest.
I'm on this stage because I'm a model.
Because I'm a nice, white woman, and in my workforce, that's being a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always do, but in a sincere way.
The first question is, how does it be model?
And I always say, a cartoons discovered me, but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I made me model is because I won the genetic lottery. And I'm the benefit of a heritage, and maybe you're wondering what this heritage.
Well, in the last few centuries, we have not only defined beauty as health and youth and symmetry -- which we are biologically programmed to admire -- we've also associated with a high and dense figure, and the feminist and a white skin.
And that's my heritage that I've been able to harness to make money.
And I know that there are people in the audience that are now specifically, and maybe there are some lovers in the fashion that say, wait. There are Naomi Somalia, Tool, Joan Simon, Limba Web.
First of all, the happy to know so much of models. It's amazing.
But sadly, I have to report that in 2007, a Ph.D. student at New York City told each and every one of the models in the runway, and of the 7.7 models, only 27 -- that is less than four percent, they weren't white.
The next question that people always do is, could it be model when it's greater?
And my first answer is: I don't know, I don't know that.
But then, what I really would tell each of these girls is, why? You can be what you want.
You can be president of the United States, or the inventor of the next Internet, or a carbon surgeon name and poet, which would be awesome, because you would be the first one.
If after this spectacular list, you still inspire, no, no, Cameron, I want to be a model, then I say, "I know my boss ...
Because I'm not in charge of nothing, and you could be the head of reduction of American magazine or the executive director of HEM, or the next Steven Minister.
To say that most of you want to be model is like saying you want to win the lottery when you're larger.
It's out of your control, it's amazing, and it's not a work you can choose.
I'm going to show you all I learned in 10 years as a model because, unlike cardiovascular surgery, can be summarized right now.
I don't know what happened there.
Sadly, once you've taken up your studies, and you have a curriculum and some jobs to your backs, no longer matter what you say, if you said you want to be president of the United States, but your subject said, model clothes for 10 years, people will look at you weird.
The next question that people are always doing is whether all pictures are coming together.
And yes, virtually all the pictures, but that's just a small part of what happens.
This was the first picture that they took me, and also the first time I used a biomass, and I didn't even have my period yet.
I know we're entering the personal ground, but it was a girl.
So I went along with my grandmother a few months earlier.
These two pictures are the same day.
My friend came with me.
Here I am on a couple of days before the pictures for the French Voice.
Here I am with my football team and in magazine V.
And this is me right now.
And I hope you realize that I'm not me in those photos.
They are creating a group of professionals, films, males, photographers and stability, and all their aid and production people and projection, and they make this. That's not me.
Well, the next question that people always do is: Do you get free things?
I have too much 20 inches and I never use, except the previous pair. But the privilege I get is the ones I get in real life, and we don't like to talk about.
I grew up in Cambridge, and once I went to a shop and I forgot to take money, and they gave me the free dress of me.
When I was a teenager, I was traveling with my friend who was a driver parameter, and he jumped out a red summit and of course, and they stopped us, and he went through a feeling -- agents to keep going.
I enjoy these privilege by my partner, not because of what I am. And there are people who are paying a price for their own without matter who they are.
I live in New York, and last year, from the 140,000 teenagers to the people who were given and recorded -- 86 percent were black and Latino and most of them were young men.
And there are only 17,000 young black young people in New York, so for them, isn't a matter of me?
But how many times will they stop me? And when?
By researching for this talk, I learned that at 53 percent of the 13-year-old girls in the United States don't like their body, and that number is elevated to 78 percent at the age of 17.
So the last question that people do is, what is the life of a model?
And I think the answer you expect is: If you're a little bit more thin, and you have the most brilliant hair, you feel very happy and great.
And behind the cameras, we give an answer that maybe it looks like.
We say, it's really wonderful to travel, and also incredible can work with creative people, ingenious and passionate people.
And all of that is true, but it's just a part of what happens, because what we never say in front of the cameras, what I've never said in front of them, is: I'm insecure.
And I'm because I have to worry about my life every day.
And if you ever ask yourself, with some more thin legs and the most brilliant hair, will it be happier.
They only have to meet with a group of models, because they have the most thin legs, the most brilliant hair and the clothes more to the fashion but probably the women physically most insecure on the planet.
But especially it was hard to analyze a situation of racial and gender oppression when I'm one of the biggest benefits.
If there is something to come from this talk, I hope that everybody feels more comfortable by recognizing the power of the image in perception that we have from success and failure.
Thank you.
Photography has been my passion since I was the biggest enough to hold a camera, but today I want to share with you my 15 more precise pictures -- and I didn't go to me who pulled them.
There were no artistic directors, no statistics, no opportunity to repeat the pictures, not even a minimum care in lighting.
In fact, most of them took them into random soul.
My story begins when, finding in New York City to give a position, my wife took me this picture holding my daughter on the day of his first birthday -- that's the corner of the 57 and the five.
He gave us the chance that we went back to New York City just a year later, so we decided to take the same picture.
Well, you can imagine what comes now.
When the third birthday of my daughter, my wife told me, why don't you take Sandam to New York in a dangerous trip and continue the ritual?
This is when we started asking the tourists that were going to take us out of the picture.
It's amazing that the gesture of delivering the camera into a complete unknown is so universal.
Never no one has been denied and, fortunately, no one has ever slept with the camera.
So we weren't aware of how much life would change this journey.
It became a sacred thing to us.
This picture is a few weeks after 9/11, and I had to explain to my daughter what had happened that day so that a five year-old girl could understand it.
These pictures are much more than representations of a concrete moment or a specific journey.
They're also a way to stop time in an October week and to make us reflect on our time and our evolution over the years, and not just physical level, but in all the senses.
Because, even though we always take the same picture, our perspective changes, my daughter raises new stories, and I can see life through your eyes and how it perceives and interacting with everything.
That time in concrete that we spend together is something we hope with illusion every year.
Recently, in one of the travel, we were walking on, when suddenly it stopped in dry and signal a red bottle of the wrist store, which was looking at a little bit of previous visit.
And he described what had felt at five years of feet in that same place.
I found that he remembered his heart painting with force by seeing that place for the first time nine years ago.
And now what you see in New York are universities, because it's decided to study in New York.
And suddenly I understood that one of the most important things that we created is memories.
So I want to share the idea of participating in the conscious creation of memories.
I don't know you, but besides these 15 pictures, I don't go out in many of the familiar pictures.
I'm always the one who takes the picture.
Today I want to encourage you to all appear in the picture, and you don't doubt to get closer to somebody and ask yourself, "Did you take a picture out of it?
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about a very special group of animals.
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world.
The boats are in the most threatened group of birds.
First of all, why are they so bad present?
It's also been associated with Disney laughter personal characters, silly characters, stupid stuff.
More recently, if you've been following your resident Kenyan press, clap and academics -- these are the attributes that associate with the Kenyan Parliament. But I don't accept.
I don't accept. You know why?
Because the members of Parliament don't keep the environment.  The parliament doesn't help prevent the spread of disease.
They are hard to make it.   They're far away from extinct.  And my favorite, the boats have better presence.   There are two types of boats on this planet.
There are the New World Bursly who are primarily found in the Americas, like the conditions and the charges, and the old World World Bursly, where we have 16 species -- of these 16, 11 faced a high risk of extinction.
So why are the boats important? First of all, provide vital ecological services, clean up.
It's our natural garbage collections.
They clean the commands up to the bone.
They help kill all the bacteria -- they help absorb the noise that they won't be for them will spread and cause huge losses of livestock and diseases in other animals.
Recent studies have shown that in areas where there are no boards, the owners take three to four times more time in devoting, and this has huge ramifications in the supply of disease.
The boats also have huge historical importance.
They've been associated with the old Egyptian culture.
New was the symbol of the prototype and the maternity and, along with the copy, they simulated the unit between the Hill and the Under Egypt.
In the Indian mythology Jack, Jack was the god bottle, and he risked his life to save the Silicon goddess of 10 heads Raisod.
In the Tibetan culture, they do some very important things in open sky -- in places like Tibet -- there's no place to bury the dead, or wood to create them, so these bottles provide a natural elimination system.
What's the problem with the doors?
We have eight species of boats in Kenya, which six are in extreme extinction.
The reason is that they're being invented and the reason they are being invented is because there are conflicts between humans and fauna, passionate communities use this venom against predators, and as a consequence, the boats are victims of this.
In South Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan, four species of bottles are in the critical list of extinction, which means that in less than 10 or 15 years old, and the reason is because they fall out of the consumer consumption that has been treated with an analog drug like Dicking.
This drug has been banned for veterinarians in India and has taken a position.
Since there are no board, there's been a spread in the number of street dogs in control seats, and when you have street dogs -- you have a huge amount of time for radio -- the number of cases of rage has increased enormously in India.
Kenya is going to have one of the largest wind parks in Africa, 365 stores are going to be above the Turking lake.
I'm not against wind energy, but we have to work with governments, because wind turbines do this to birds -- they cut them in half.
They're birds of birds.
In Western Africa, there's a horrible trade of dead doors to serve the bureaucrat and the factory market.
So what is it doing? Well, we're looking at these birds -- we're putting them out.
We're trying to determine their basic ecology and see where they go.
We can see that they travel by different countries, so focus on a local problem is not going to serve anything.
We have to work with governments in regional levels.
We're working with local communities.
We're talking to them about appreciation to the boats, about the need to appreciate these wonderful creatures and services that provide them.
How can you help? You can become assets, make noise. You can write a letter to your government and tell you, we have to focus on these very unconscious creatures. It will donate their time to spread the word. It will spread the word.
When you get out of this room, you will inform you on the bottles, but you talk to your families, with your children, with your neighbors on the bottom.
They're very elegant -- Charles Darwin said it changed from opinion because he saw them flying without effort, without energy spending in the heavens.
Kenya, this world, will be much more poor without these wonderful species.
Thank you very much.
Every thing I do and everything I do -- profoundly -- my life, has been shaped for seven years of work during my youth in Africa.
Since 1970 to 1977, I fell young, but no longer am.  I worked in Zambia. Kenya, Mars, Marshall, Argentina and Somalia, in technical cooperation projects with African countries.
I worked for an Italian NGO and every project that we set up in Africa.
And I was serviced.
I thought, at the age of 21, that Italians were good people, and we were doing a good job in Africa.
Instead of that, everything we were doing we analyzed it.
Our first project, which inspired my first book, "One of Zambia -- was a project where some Italians decided to teach people about Zambia.
So we arrived with Italian seeds south of Zambia.
And of course, people weren't at all interested in doing that, so we were paid to come to work, and sometimes they didn't happen.  We were amazed that local locals, in so fertile Valley, didn't have any agriculture.
But instead of asking you how it was possible that they didn't grow anything, we just said, "Thank God we are here."  "I just have time to save the people in the Mamaican of Human."
And of course, everything in Africa is beautifully grown.
We got these magnificent tomatoes in Italy, a tomato will grow up to this size. In Zambia.
And we couldn't believe it, we were saying to the black, "Look how easy the agriculture is.
When the tomatoes were bone, mature and red, at night in the morning, about 200 humps appeared from the river and ate everything.  And we said to the blood ships, "My God -- the humble mess."
And the campaigns said, "Yes, that's why we don't have agriculture here --  "Why didn't you say that? You never ask.
I thought we were just the Italians we made mistakes in Africa, but then I saw what Americans did, what the English did, what the French did, and after seeing what they were doing, I felt pretty proud of our project in Zambia.
Because, as you see, at least we feed the hopeful.
You should see the waste --  You should see the waste that we gave them to the trusted people in Africa.
He wants to read a book, read "Dead Death of Monic Devil, bank economist.
The book was published in 2009.
We, Western donors -- we have entered the African continent two million dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you about the damage that that money has caused it.
Just read your book.
Take it from an African woman, the damage we've done.
The Westerners are implications, colonies collective, and we treat people just in two ways: or we package them, or we're patient.
The two words come from Latin Ray Ray," which means "Dad!"
But they mean two different things.
Patient, I treat any of a different culture as if they were my children, "I want a lot.
Patrial, I treat everybody in a different culture as if they were my services.
So the whites in Africa are called "Baby: bees.
That book gave me a slap in the face. "The little thing is beautiful, written by Schulk, who said about all of the economic development -- if people don't want to be help, advanced them.
This should be the first principle of aid.
The first principle of aid is to respond.
This morning, the gentleman who opened this conference put a cane on the ground and said, can you imagine a city that's not negatively negative?
I decided to do at the age of 27 just to respond to people, and I invented a system called "Compartment Facility where you never start nothing, you never motivate anyone, but it becomes a service of local passion, the sensor of local localities, who have the dream of becoming a better person.
So what do you do? It's street.
It never gets to a community with an idea, and it sits with the people of the logic.
We don't work from the offices.
We met in a coffee cafe. We met in a bar.
We have zero infrastructure.
And what do we do? We become friends, and we find out what the person wants to do.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give you an idea to someone.
If that person doesn't want to do that, what will you do?
The passion that she has for its own growth is the most important.
The passion that man has for its own personal growth is the most important thing.
And then, we help them find knowledge, because nobody in the world can succeed alone.
The person with the idea may not have knowledge, but knowledge is available.
So years and years ago, I had this idea: Why not us, for once instead of getting to a community to tell people what to do, why not, for once we hear them, but not in community meetings.
Let me tell you a secret.
There's a problem with community meetings.
entrepreneurs never support, and they will never tell you, in a public meeting, what they want to do with their own money, what opportunity they have indicated.
So planning has this blind point.
The smartest people in their community, you don't even know them, because they don't attend their public meetings.
What do we do? We work one to one, and we work faces, you have to create a social infrastructure, which doesn't exist.
You must create a new profession.
The profession is the family physician of the company, the business family, which is established with you in your house, at the table of your kitchen, and that helps you find the resources to transform your passion in a way of making your life.
I started this as a test.
I was doing a Ph.D. at that time, trying to get away from this concerned trash where we came to tell you what to do.
In one year, I had 27 projects, and the government came to me to say, "How can you do that?
How can you do it? And I said, "I did something very, very, very hard.
And I shut up and I heard it."  So the government says, "Get it up."  We have done it in 300 communities in the world.
We've helped start 40,000 business.
There's a new generation of entrepreneurs that are dying of loneliness.
Peter Drugs, one of the greatest business advisers in history, passed at '96, a few years ago.
Peter Drug was a philosophy professor before involved in business, and this is what Peter Drazine: "The planning is actually incompatible with a society and an economy of innovative company.
planning is the kiss of the death of business spirit.
So now you are rebuilding Christian without knowing what the most distant people in Christian want to do with their own money and their own energy.
You have to learn how to get these people together to come together with you.
You have to offer you confidence, privacy -- it has to be fantastic when you help them, and then they will come in a mass basis.
In a community of 10,000 people, we got 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people, intelligence and passion.
Which presentation you've been applied to this morning, right?
And that's what you have applied.
So what I tell you is that the entrepreneurial spirit is where it is.
We are at the end of the first industrial revolution -- fundamental fossil fuels, manufacturing -- and from one moment to another, we have systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
The face as a way of holding machinery is not sustainable.
What we need to consider is how we nuclear, we cure, we education, transportation, we communicate to seven billion people, in a sustainable way.
There are no technologies to do that.
Who is going to invent technology for the green revolution, constructions? Forget it.
The government? Forget it.
They're going to be the entrepreneurs and they're doing it now.
There's an amazing story that I read in a future magazine many, many years ago.
There was a group of experts that were invited to debate the future of New York City in the year 1850.
And in the year 1860, this group of people gathered this group of people together, and they speculated about what happened to New York City in 100 years, and the conclusion was annoy: New York City would not exist within 100 years.
Why? Because they analyzed the curve and they pointed out, if the population keeps growing up to this rate, to bring to the population of New York to the all, would require six million horses. And the manure produced by six million horses would be impossible to learn.
They were already stripping in dung --  So in 1800, they were dividing this dirty technology that would show New York life.
So what happens? In the next 40 years, in 1900, in the United States came up 100 manufacturers manufacturer community, 1008.
The idea of finding a different technology was absolutely absorbed and there were very few scarce, scarce, factories in places that were standing.
Dennisha, Michigan. Henry Ford Henry.
However, there is a secret to work with entrepreneurs.
First, you have to offer you confidence.
Otherwise, they're not going to be talking with you.
Then, you have to offer you an absolute absolute, decided, entertainment service.
And prototyping, you will have to tell you the truth about it.
The smallest company, the largest company, has to be able to make three things great -- the product that you want to sell has to be fantastic, you have to tell with a fantastic commercial, and you have to tell you with a fantastic financial administration.
You know what?
We've never met a single human being in the world that can do, sell and look for the money alone.
It doesn't exist.
This hasn't been born.
We've investigated and looked at the 100 Western companies in the Carnegie world, Westerlen, Edison Editon, all the new companies -- Google, Yakey.
There is just one thing that all successful companies in the world have in common, only one: none of us was initiated by one person.
Not the word "I said, but the word "we use: 32 times.
He wasn't just when he started.
Nobody starts a company alone. No one.
So we can create the community where we have facilities, who come from an environment of small businesses sitting in coffee caps, in bars along with their deal with the ones who are going to do for you, which someone did by this gentleman who speak to you, what do you need?
What can you do? Can you do it?
Okay, can you sell it? Can you look for money?
"Oh, no, I can't do that." "Would you want me to look for someone for?"
We activate communities.
Thank you.
People who surround us can help us in many ways to improve our lives.
We don't know all the neighbors, so we don't exchange a lot of knowledge despite sharing the same public spaces.
In the last few years, I've tried to share more with my neighbors in public space, with simple tools like automation, plans and chalk.
These projects came out of questions like, how much paid my neighbors for their apartment?
How can we pay and ask more things without calling the door in a bad moment?
How do we share more memories of our abandoned buildings and understand our landscape?
How do we share more our hopes to the empty stores so that our communities can reflect our needs and dreams?
I live in New Orleans and I'm love in New Orleans.
My soul always finds relief with the giant robots who give shadows to lovers and drunk and soldiers for centuries and confidence in a city.
It always gives the music.  There is a decline in New Orleans.  The city has one of the most beautiful architects in the world, but also one with the largest number of U.S.
I live near this house and thought how I could turn it into a more enjoyable space for the neighborhood and also something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost someone who loved a lot.
It was Jona, as a mother for me.
Her death was repeated and unexpected.
I thought a lot about death.
And this produced me a deep gratitude for the lived time.
He gave him clarity to the significant things of my life today.
But I want to keep this look in my everyday life.
It seems to me that it's easy to let me catch the day and forget the really important thing for one.
So with the help of old and new friends transformed the wall of this house abandoned in a giant slate and painted on her phrases to complete and I want to go away."
So the trains could take a skin, reflect on their lives and share personal aspirations in public space.
I didn't know what to expect this experiment, but the next day the wall was filled and kept covering it.
And I'd like to share some things that people wrote on the wall.
Before I die, I want to be judged by paradox."  Before I die, I want to sit in the speech of date change.
Before I die, I want to sing for millions of people."
Before I die, I want to plant a tree.
Before I die, I want to live outside the Web.
Before I die, I want to hug you one more time.
Before I die, I want to go to the rescue of someone.
Before I die, I want to be completely myself."
This abandoned space became constructive and the dreams and the hopes of people made me laugh in cardiac and destroy me, and they gave me a conversation in hard times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone. It's about understanding our neighbors in new and scaled ways. It's about giving birth to reflection and control, and to remember what is most important for us as we grow and change.
This happened last year, and I started getting hundreds of messages of passionate people who wanted to make a wall in their community.
So with my colleagues of the civic center, we made a kit, and now they've been made in countries around the world, like Kazakhstan, South Africa, Australia and beyond.
Together, we demonstrate the power of our public spaces if they give us the opportunity to express and share each other.
Two of the most valuable things we have is time and our relationships with other people.
In our era of distribution -- it's more important than ever, to find ways to preserve the perspective and remember that life is brief.
Death is something that we often avoid talking about, or even thinking, but I understood that preparing for death is one of those things that trust us more power.
Think of the clear death our life.
Our shared spaces can reflect better what matters as individuals and as a community and more means to share hope, fears and stories, the people around us not only can help improve places, can help improve our lives.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I have a only request today.
Please don't tell me I'm normal.
Now I'd like to introduce you to my brothers now.
remix is 22 years old, it's high and very fat.
It doesn't talk about it, but transmitted better than some of the best properties.
remix knows what love is.
And I share it initially is what happens.
It's not advanced. It doesn't look at the color of the skin.
They don't care about religious differences and look at this: never lied.
When I sing songs from our childhood, trying to make words that I couldn't even remember me, I remember one thing: how little we know about the mind and the wonderful thing that should be the unknown.
Samuel is 16 years old. It's high. It's very fat.
It gives you the most impossible memory.
However, it's a selective memory.
I don't remember if I stole my chocolate, but I remember the year I came out every single songs of my iPod, conversations that we kept when I was four years old, making me Dad in my arm during the first episode of Telescopes and the birthday of Lady Gandhi.
Don't you seem incredible?
But most people don't agree with it.
And in fact, because their minds don't adjust to the concept of normal society, they're often ignored and unconscious.
But what drives my heart and forced my soul was that even if that was the case, although they wouldn't consider them within the ordinary thing, that could only mean one thing: that were extraordinary, autistic and extraordinary.
Now, for those less familiar with the term autism, it's a complex brain disorder that affects social communication, learning and sometimes physical skills.
In each individual it is divided differently, it is so different from Sam.
And all over the world, every 20 minutes, is diagnosed a new case of autism, and even though it's one of the disorders of development that faster increases in the world, there is no cause or any known cure.
I don't remember my first encounter with autism, but I don't remember a single day without it.
I was just three years old when my brother came to the world, and I was very excited about having a new life in my life.
When you spent a few months, I realized that he was different.
I shout a lot.
I didn't want to play like the other babies, and in fact, it didn't seem very interested in me at all.
And he was living and he refused in his own world, with his own rules, and he found pleasure in the smallest things, like putting cars on row around the room, looking at the washing washing and eating anything that had been in between.
As it grew up, it became more different, and the differences were made more evidence.
But beyond blood, frustration and interactive hypertextionic, there was something really unique -- a pure nature and innocent nature, a child who saw the world without prejudice -- a human being that had never lied.
Extraordinary.
I can't deny that there have been some difficult moments in my family, moments I would have wish that they were just like me.
But I look back at the things that have taught me about individualism, communication and love, and I realize that they are things that wouldn't want to change the normal.
Normal goes through the beauty that give us differences and the fact of being different doesn't mean that any one is wrong.
It just means there's a different view of what's right.
If I could convey a single thing to Red and Sam and you, it would be that they don't have to be normal.
They can be extraordinary.
Because autistic or not, the differences we have -- they're a gift. Each of us has a gift inside and honestly, the pursuit of normal.
The opportunity for gravity, progress and change die at the time we try to be like others.
Please don't tell me I'm normal.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I experienced a little bit that must have been Alice in the Magazine country.
Penn State asked me, a communications teacher, who would give a kind of communication to engineering students.
I was scared.  It was scared of truth -- scared of these students with their big minds, their big books and their big books and the unknown words.
But by developing those conversations -- I felt what Alice must have felt when he fell through the hole of the rabbit and saw the door of a new world.
I just felt like I had those conversations with students, and I was surprised by the ideas they had, and I wanted others to experience this wonderful world.
And I think the key to open that door is a great communication.
We need a desperate communication of our scientists and engineers in order to change the world.
Our scientists and engineers are the ones that are attacking our biggest challenges, from energy to the environment and care care of health, among others, and if we don't know about this, the work is not done, and I think it's our responsibility as not scientists to have these interactions.
But these great conversations can't happen if our scientists and engineers are not invited us to see their wonderful world.
So scientists and engineers, please.
I want to share some suggestions about how you can do it to make sure that your science is sexy and your engineering is attractive.
First question to answer them, and then what?
Tell us why science is relevant to us.
They don't just tell us that they study the tribes, but they study the trials, which are the mesh structure of our bones because it's important to understand and treat the opposition.
And when they're describing their science, careful with jargon.
The jargon is an obstacle for our understanding of their ideas.
Sure, you can say "specialist and temperature: but why don't you say "specialist and time, which is much more accessible to us?
To make them accessible is not the same thing to make them tons.
Instead, as Einstein said, it's all as simple as possible, but not simple.
They can communicate clearly their science without making ideas.
One thing to consider is to use examples and stories and analogies -- they're ways of getting and excited with their content.
And by presenting their work, forget the signs of baby."
They have wondered why they call basically?  What do they do? The banks kill, and they will kill their presentation.
One film like this is not only boring, but it's been supported too much in the language area of our brain and overwhelmed us.
Instead, this example of Green Brown example is much more effective, shows than the special structure of the tribes is so strong that I really inspired the unique design of the Eiffel Tower Toron.
The trick here is to use a simple sentence, legally, that the public can understand if you lose a little bit, and then you will provide graphs that apply to our other senses and create a deeper sense of understanding what you describe in.
And I think these are just some key ones that can help us get our door and see the country of the wonders that are science and engineering.
And so scientists and engineers, when you've solved this equation, all over the middle, let's talk about it.  Thank you.
One of my favorite words of all the Oxford English dictionary is to self.
Just because it sounds very well.
And "I will self-reporte it means "forged political."
Although there was a percentage of the 19th century of the 19th century that defined it much better when he said, "A slide is the one who looks for a public burden without matter particular, platform or principle -- and that when you win, you get it for the use of a resource magnificent monument."
I have no idea what it means reflection."
Something to do with words, I guess.
It's very important that words are the basis in politics, and that all politicians know that they have to try to dominate language.
It wasn't until for example, 177,000 that the British Parliament allowed the newspapers to quote the exact words that were said in the parliament camera.
And all of this was because of the courage of a guy with the name of Brian Cross, who was confronted by Parliament at the time.
And they got them in the London Tower and they were incarcerated to him, but he had the enough courage to face them, and at the end he had such a popular support in London who won.
And just a few years later, we had the first record of the phrase that blood like the metal."
Most people think it's literature.
It's not. It's because of a freedom of freedom of expression.
But to show you really how words and politics interact, I want you to come back to America, just after the independence.
So they had to address the question of how to call George Washington, his leader.
They didn't know.
How do you call the leader of a reported country reported?
This was defined in Congress for a long time.
They were all kinds of suggestions that could have failed.
Some of you wanted to call it Washington de Santa Washington: "The Alexander George Washington: and other Departments of the U.S.
Not very attractive.
Some just wanted to call it "Read."
They thought it was a quality of quality.
And not even with it were manifestations, they had the idea that you could be elected King for a certain degree.
And I could have served it.
Everybody is signing up, because this debate is promised for three weeks.
I read the newspaper of a poor, and I always wrote, "I'm still with this issue."
What caused the return and the under was that the House of Representatives was against the Senate.
The Pear of Representatives didn't want Washington to be emerged.
They didn't want to call it King by whether he was giving him or his own ideas.
So they wanted to give you the most modest title and more instinctively and more Sadly, and it occurred to them.
And that title was President."
President. They didn't invent the title -- there was already before, but it only meant somebody who pressed a meeting."
It was like the president of a jury.
And I didn't have much more gravity than the term "analyzzler or "surface."
There were events of small colonial and government fractions, but it was really an insignificant.
And that's why the Senate comes up.
They said, "It's ridiculous, we can't call it President."
"This guy has to sign treated and return with foreign diagnostics."
"And who would take seriously with a simplified and insignificant title like President of America?
And finally, after three weeks of debate, the Senate didn't code.
We can learn three interesting things about all this.
First of all, and this is my favorite as far as I've been able to figure out, the Senate has never recently sold the President of President.
President Barack Obama has lucky enough to stay there, waiting for the Senate between action.
The second thing that we can learn is that when a government says that one measure is temporary --  -- we can keep waiting for 22 years more.
But the third thing we can learn, and this is the most important thing, and this is what I want to leave you with, is that the U.S. President title doesn't sound at all.
Especially if you have more than 5,000 nuclear heads to devices, the largest economy in the world and a fleet of flying air vehicles and so on.
Reality and history have given the title of gravity.
So at the end of the end won.
They got their responsibility.
And also the other concern of the Senate, the appearance of uniqueness -- well, it was a uniqueness of it.
But you know how many nations are there now?
And everything because they want to sound like the type of 5,000 nuclear heads, etc.
So at the end of the Senate won and the Commandment of Representatives lost, because no one is going to feel humble when they tell them that they're now the President of America.
And I think that's the great lesson that we can learn, and that I would like to leave you with.
The politicians try to choose and use the words to shape and control reality, but really, it is a much more modified reality that they could change reality.
Thank you very much.
I'm 45 to feet underground.
The air is loaded from heat and dust, and it's hard to breathe.
I feel the rock of supermarket bodies in the dark, but I can't see much more.
I hear voices who speak but above all, that cathedral of male money and stones with primitive tools.
Like others, I take a cheap light line on the head with this anti-car lighting, and I can barely distinguish the branches of that hole of a meter that drops hundreds of meters on the ground.
And I got up my hand and I suddenly remember a mining that I met days before, who lost the control and fell in a few feet in that piece.
As I talk to you today, these men are in the deep of that hole risking their lives without paying and often dying.
And I came out of that hole and I went home, but they'll probably never do it, because they're pressure of slavery.
In the last 28 years, I was documenting native cultures in over 70 countries in six continents, and in 2009, I had the great honor of being the only exhibition at the Vancouver Peace Punch.
Among all the amazing people I met there I met an integrated from French the South So Alexander: an NGO who is dedicated to eradicate modern slavery.
So we started talking about slavery and, really, I started learning about slavery because I knew that there was in the world, but not such grade.
When we finished talking to me, I felt very bad. I was honestly embarrassed to ignore this attraction of our days and I thought, if I don't know, how many people don't know?
I was made by the stomach, and weeks later, I flew Los Angeles to meet the French director of the Sanitary and offer my help.
So I started my journey to modern slavery.
Interestingly, I've been in many of these places.
Some of them even considered them my second home.
But this time, I would sell the dirty traffic.
A conservative calculation says that there are more than 27 million people slavery in the world.
It's twice the amount of Africans displaced throughout the stage of momentous slavery.
150 years ago, the cost of an agricultural slave was about three times the annual wage of a U.S. worker.
The equivalent of about 50,000 dollars.
But today you can enslave the entire families for generations for names of 18 dollars.
Amazingly, slavery generates profits from over 13 billion dollars a year around the world.
Many of them have been fooled with false promise of good education and better work for then discovering that they're forced to work without pay, under threat of violence and can't escape.
Today, slavery operates in the crime, goods produced by slaves have value, but who produce them are disappeared.
Slide exists in almost everybody and yet, it's illegal around the world.
In India and Nepal, I met the books of bricks.
This strange and formidable spectrum was like entering the old Egypt or the Denisce of Darwin.
Inservant at a temperature of 54 degrees -- men, women, children, in fact family families wrapped in a heavy store of dust -- they stack mechanically brick in their heads, to 18 at the time, and they take them from ordinary furnaces to trucks that are hundreds of feet.
Demonstrations for the Montreal and the convenience work in silence, doing this task over and over again for 16 or 17 hours a day.
There were no pains to eat, not to drink, and the severe destroying made it pee to be quite interesting.
So penny was the heat and the dust that my camera became too hot, and stopped working.
Every 20 minutes, I had to run into the car to clean the team and make it work with air conditioning to check it, and sitting there, I thought, my camera gets a much better treatment than these people.
Back in the oven I wanted to cry, but the advance I was at my side quickly grabbed me and said, "Let, don't do it. Don't do it here."
And I was very clearly explained to demonstrate emotions is very dangerous in places like this, not just for me but for them.
I couldn't offer them any direct help.
I couldn't give them money, nothing.
I was not a citizen of that country.
I could put them in a worse situation than they were already gone.
I had to rely on the Saturn and work inside the system for your release, and trust you to get it.
As far as me, I hope to get home to feel my heart shower.
In the Himalayas, I found kids running rocks for miles by mountain terrain to trucks that were waiting down.
Those big blanks were more heavy than children who were carrying them and children were holding them to their heads with the road rooms made out of sticks, ropes and harmones.
It's hard to witness something so overwhelmed.
How can we influence something so insidious but so mining?
Some people don't even know they're slaves -- and they work 16 or 17 hours a day without pay, because this has been all his life.
They have nothing to compare with.
When these villages were recording their freedom, the slaves burned their homes.
When we hear the word slavery often we thought about sexual traffic, and because of this global awareness I was told that it would be hard for me to work with security in this particular business.
In Katherin, I was accompanied by women who had been previously sexual slaves.
I was driven by some anonymous stairs that gave this dirty basement, of tender floor forest.
It was not exactly a strange.
It was rather a restaurant.
Researcher, as you know in the office, are local for forced prostitution.
They have small rooms -- private rooms, where the women -- with their girls and children, some of just seven years -- are forced to enter the clients and encourage them to buy more food and alcohol.
Each dot is dark and disorder, identified by a number painted on the wall and divided by a biomass and a curtain.
workers often suffer sexual abuse by their clients.
On my pain, I remember having felt an ordered fear of it, and in that instant, I could barely imagine what should be stuck in that hell.
I only had a salary: the stairs where he came in.
There were no back doors.
There were no big enough windows like the trip.
Those people don't have a school, and because we play such a difficult topic, it's important to point out that slavery even sexual traffic happens around us.
There are hundreds of people slavery in agriculture, in restaurant in the domestic service, and the list can continue.
Recently, the New York Times reported that between 100,000 and 300,000 American children are sold every year as sexual slaves.
It happens around you, but we don't see it.
Textiles are another activity that we often relate to the slave labor hand.
I visited Indian villages in which there were known families in the silk trade.
This is a family portrait here.
The bones of black are from the father, the blue tissues and red, of their children.
They mix ink in these big barrels and they dip the silk in the liquid to the ears, but the ink is toxic.
My performer told me his stories.
"We don't have freedom," they said.
"We still hope, however, can come out of this house someday and go somewhere where we really pay our work."
It's estimated that there are over 4,000 children slavery in Lake Volvo, the largest artificial lake in the world.
When we arrived, I went to take a quick look.
I saw what seemed to be a fish family in a boat, two older brothers, some younger kids, makes sense of it?
Wrong. They were all slaves.
Children are separated from their traded families, disappeared and forced to work external toys in these boats in the lake, despite not knowing swimming.
This child is eight years old.
When our boat was approaching it was set, it feared that his little canoe was failed.
He was paralyzed by the fear of falling into water.
The branches of the breakthrough trees in the Lake Voice often catch networks and children, favorite and fear and fear, are thrown into the water to unleash the branches.
Many of them are drowned away.
Since remember, it's always been forced to work on the lake.
For fear of his love it's not going to flee and, like all life has been treated with critical, it creates the younger slaves under their command.
I met these guys at five o'clock in the morning, when they came up with the last networks, but they had been working from the one of the ones.
In the cold and windy night.
And it can point out that these networks weigh over 400 pounds when they're full of fish.
I want to introduce you to Kob.
Kofi was rescued in a fishing village.
I met it in a shelter where French the Sanital reference to slavery victims.
Kofi symbolizes the possible.
Who will become because someone decided to make the difference in their life?
driving up a road in Ghana with French partners the South So the South Solar And a former advanced partner with its motorcycle suddenly accelerate and supermarkets our car and played the window.
We were asked to follow it for a dirt path to the jungle.
At the end of the way, we were inspired to get out of the car, and he asked the driver that came out quickly.
And then I pointed out this sense just visible and said, "This is the track, this is the way. Come on!
As we started to go down, we took the entrepreneurs that blocked the way and after walking about an hour, we found that the path was attached to the recent rain, so I put the photo team on my head as we went down in these waters to the chest.
After two hours of walking, the simple way ended up absolutely in a clear, and we had a mass of holes that could fit in a football field, and they were all filled with slave workers.
Many women had children tied up to their backs, and while they were looking for gold, they walked into the water with mercur.
The market is used in the extraction process.
These miners are slavery in one part of Ghana.
When they came out of the wells they were packed in their own sweat.
I remember looking at his naked eyes, ironic eyes, since many had been under land for 72 hours.
The wells have up to 90 feet and these people are carrying heavy stone bags that will then be transported to another area where they will make the stone to extract the gold.
First of all, the site seems to be filled strong and distant men but if we look closer to it, the margin we see to work on the other lucky and also children.
They're all victims of injuries, diseases and violence.
In fact, it's very likely that this muscle ends up like this victim of tuberculosis and the engineering of the neighborhood in a few years.
This is Manhattan. When his father died, his father took him to work with him in the mines.
When you die his uncle, Manhattan inherited the debt of the uncle that force it to be slave in the mines.
When I met it, I had worked in the mines 14 years and the injury of the leg that you see here is a product of an accident in the mines, so serious that doctors said it should be amazed.
In addition to that, Manhattan has tuberculosis, and it's not open to that, it's forced to work night and day in that mine.
Yet, he dreams with being released and educated with local activists like French the Sanital, and it's this kind of determination of face to a remote possibility, which inspires me a lot of respect.
I want to throw light on slavery.
They knew that their images would be seen for you around the world.
I wanted you to know that we'll give us testimony of them and we'll do everything possible to help change their lives.
I just believe that if we can see each other as human beings, then it makes it very difficult to tolerate atrocities like slavery.
These images are not from magazines -- they're from people, real people, like you and like me, who deserve the same rights, dignity and respect in their lives.
There's no day that I happen that I don't think about these so many beautiful people, male people, that I've had the great honor to know.
I hope that these images wake up a force in who you see them, in people like you, and I hope that that force takes a fire, and that fire throws light on slavery because without that light, the kiss of slavery can continue to live in shadows.
Thank you very much.
I do mathematical application, and there's a peculiar problem for whom it does, we're like management consumers.
Nobody knows what the hell we do.
So I'm going to try to explain to you what I do.
The dance is one of the most human activities.
We have the balls of the ballet and the crash dancers -- that we will see later.
But the ballet demands a degree of extraordinary training, a high level of dexterity and probably certain initial application that can well have a genetic component.
Sadly, neurological disorders like Parkinson's disease, gradually destroy this extraordinary ability, as it does with my friend Jane Strawn who, in his time, was a virtue of ballet dance.
In the last few years, it has been very progress in treatment.
However, there are six million people in the world that are sick, and they have to deal with an incurable weakness and temperatures, recording and other symptoms of this disease, so we need objective tools to detect the disease before it's too late.
We need to be able to measure progress in a objective way, and ultimately, the only way we will know if there is really a cure will be when we have a objective and a certainty.
But it's frustrating that for the Parkinson's and other disorders of the movement there are no biological markers, so they don't serve blood analysis and the best we have is a neurological exam of 20 minutes.
You have to go to a clinic to do it. It's very, very expensive, and that means that outside the clinical trials, you never do. It's never done.
And what if patients could do it at home?
That would save a hard journey to the clinic -- what if patients could be able to do the exam them?
It wouldn't be personal.
By the way, it costs about 300 dollars in the neurological clinic.
So what I want to propose with you as no conventional way to try to try and try to do it, you see, in a sense, we are all virtuous as my friend Jane Strawn.
This is a video of the violence of vocal strings.
It shows someone healthy as it emits sounds when you speak. We can imagine as dancers of a vocal ballet because we have to coordinate all those vocal organs to produce sounds and we all have the necessary genes -- the Fox, for example.
And like Ebola, it requires an extraordinary training level.
Let's think about how long it takes a child to learn how to speak.
From the sound, we can trace the position of vocal strings as they vibrate and just like Parkinson's affects extremes, also affecting the vocal organs.
On the bottom tree you can see an example of the irregular common cords.
We see the same symptoms.
And vocal and dimensional democracy religion.
The speech becomes more quiet and applicating after a while, and this is an example of symptoms.
How do you compare these exams based on the voice with specialized clinical trials -- well, both of these are not invasive.
The neurological test is not invasive -- both use existing infrastructure.
You don't need to design a whole series of hospitals to do it.
Both of them are precise. Well, but also the tests based on voice are not specialized.
I mean, they can be automated.
They do very quickly, they take about 30 seconds like a lot.
They are a minimal cost and we all know what happens to happen.
When something takes a cost so low, it comes to mass scale.
These are some incredible goals.
We can reduce the logistical difficulties of patients.
It wouldn't make the clinic to go to the clinic for the routine check.
With high frequencies, we could get objective data.
We could make massive record record for clinical trials, and for the first time, factor checks at the general scale.
We have the opportunity to start looking for the first biomass of disease before it's too late.
So by giving today the first steps in that sense, we're launching the vocal institution of the Parkinson's Victoria.
Together and Player and Physican, we want to register a lot of voices around the world to collect enough data and start to address these goals.
We have accessible local lines for about 750 million people in the world.
Anyone with Paris, you can call low price and leave recording for a few cents, and I'm pleased to announce that we've already reached six percent of the goal in just eight hours.
Thank you.   Tom Rielly: So Max taking all these samples of, say, 10,000 people, can you say who's healthy and who doesn't?
What would you take out of these shows?
Max Litter: Yeah, yeah. What happens is that during the call you have to indicate whether you have or not the disease. TR: Sure.
MM: You see, some people may not happen. You may not get it.
But we're going to get a very large sample of data collected in different circumstances, and do it in different circumstances is important because we're looking for limited conflict factors in pursuit of the real markers of disease.
TR: Do you have 86 percent accuracy at this time?
MM: Much more than that.
Actually, my student Thailand, I have to advertise it, has done a fantastic job and now has shown that it works on the mobile phone network too, which is the project that does have a 99 percent accuracy now.
TR: Nover and nine. Well, it's a improvement.
MM: Absolutely.
TR: Thank you very much. Max Litter, public.
MM: Thank you, Tom.
Before March 2011, I made photographs in New York City.
We're paralyzed creatures, gray.
We hide in the dark, in rooms without windows and, usually we avoid solar light.
We make the streamlined models even more thin -- the perfect perfect skin we do the impossible, possible and criticize us in the press all the time, but some of us are really artists with talent with many years of experience and a real taste.
On March 11, 2011, I saw from my house, just like the rest of the world, the tragic events that happen in Japan.
A little bit of time later, an organization where it was voluntary -- there Hans Volvo, was in the place working as part of the answer team.
I, along with hundreds of other volunteers, we knew we couldn't stay at home, so I decided to join the group for three weeks.
On May 13, I traveled to Olympic.
It's a little fishing village located in the Paternation of almost 50,000 people, one of the first people affected by the wave.
The recorded water level reached over 24 feet tall.
As you can imagine, the village was devastating.
We took scratch rubble and bones.
We cleaned up schools. We took the side and leave the houses ready to be renewed and red.
We take tons and tons of dead, supermarket, power of local factory.
We tested and loved it.
For weeks, both volunteers as neighbors found similar things.
They found pictures and photos of photos and cameras and DNA cards.
Everybody did the same thing.
You can pick them up and take them to different places of people around to keep them.
It wasn't until then I realized that those pictures represented a huge part of the personal losses that those people had suffered for.
While they fled the wave, and to save their lives, they had to abandon absolutely everything they had.
At the end of my first week, I started to help in a village education.
He helped clean out the communal bathrooms the huge, giant banks.
This place turned out to be also the place of the village where the crash center collected the photos.
And they took them there, and I had the honor that that day would trust me to clean the photos.
This was exciting and inspiring -- I had heard the expression to think beyond the horizon, but it wasn't until I brought myself my horizons.
When you look at the pictures, I found some that had over a hundred years old, some of them were still in the lab, I couldn't avoid thinking as a response how to fix that trait and repair that trait and knew hundreds of people who could do the same thing.
So that night I entered Facebook contact with some of them, and the next morning, the answer was so overwhelming and positive that I knew we had to try.
So we started to challenge the photos.
This was the first of all.
It wasn't too strange, but where the water had driven the face of the girl should be reduced with a lot of precision and deception.
Otherwise, that girl would not have the aspect of her, and that would be as tragic as having the strange picture.
With the time step -- they came up with more photos, and they needed more responsibility so that he entered Facebook and Linds and five days later, 80 people from 12 countries offered to help.
At the course of two weeks I had 150 people who are willing to join up.
In Japan, in July, we moved to Richard, a neighbor town north of Mam.
Once a week we used our scanner in the temporal photographs that had been installed where people were going to reclaim their photos.
The time they took to show them is a different story, depending on the performance of the photos.
I could implement an hour. I could implement weeks.
It could implement months.
So this guy had to draw practically by hand using the areas whose color and detailed the water was not destroyed.
It took a long time.
The water destroyed all these pictures that are suspended in salt water, covered bacteria covered with algae, even oil -- all of this with the time step along with the time -- so that we wipe it by hand was an important part of the project.
We couldn't pick up the picture unless it was clean, dry and it would have been reclaimed by his owner.
We were lucky with a hand.
We count with the guide of a removed neighborhood.
It's very easy to give even more the pictures already now.
As Benning once said, the leader of my group is like making a tattoo.
You can't make mistakes.
The woman who brought us these pictures was lucky to the photos.
He had begun to wipe it out of her, but he stopped when he realized that she would give them even more.
I also had doubled.
Without them, the images of their husband and their own face would not be able to reconstruct it, we could flap the images in one picture and pick the whole picture.
When he picked up his pictures shared some of his story with us.
A few colleagues of his husband found the pictures in a bomb station between the scratch of the rubble that used to be their house, but their colleagues recognized it.
The day of the tsunami, his husband was the convention of shutting the barriers into the wave.
It had to go inside the water while the surgery sounded out.
Their small children, not so small now, but their two children were in school, in different schools.
One of them was trapped in the water.
He took him a week to find his family and know that they all had survived.
The day he handed her pictures his youngest son turned 14 years.
For her, despite all of this, those pictures were the best gift I could do it, something that he could look at -- something that I could remember from the past that he would not have been marked by the March day when everything in his life changed or destroyed.
After six months in Japan 1,100 volunteers had joined there Hans hundreds of them helped us clean over 135,000 photographs -- the great majority --  -- the vast majority went back to their owners -- important.
Over 500 volunteers around the world helped us give up to 90 families hundreds of totally restaurants and refugees.
During this time, we really don't spend over 1,000 dollars in teams and materials, most of them in ink for printer.
We take pictures constantly.
A picture is a memory of someone or something, a place, a relationship, somebody dear it.
They're guarding of our memories and stories, the last thing we would take -- but the first thing we're going to look for.
This was what the project was about, to restore small pieces of humanity, to return to someone their connection with the past.
When a picture like this is coming back to somebody, it makes a huge difference in the life of the person who receives it.
This project also made a big difference in the life of responsibility.
Some of them connected them with something bigger -- they will go back to something, using their talent for something that won't be straight models of perfect skin.
In closing, I would like to read this email email -- I sent it Cindy the day that I went back from Japan after six months.
While I was relaxing, I couldn't avoid thinking about people and stories shown in the images.
One in particular, a picture with women from different ages from the grandmother to the small child, gathered around a baby, combined, because a similar picture of my family my grandmother, my mother, I and my national daughter born from our wall.
In the entire world, in all the basic needs to be the same, right?
Thank you.  applause.
Doctor Edison inspired us angry and curiosity with this picture of a bullet that goes through an apple in an exhibition of only one million seconds.
But now, 50 years later, we can go a million times faster and see the world not to a million or a billion frames per second.
I introduce you a new kind of photography, photographer, a new technique that can create videos in slow camera from light in motion.
And with that we can create cameras that you can see after the rings, beyond the vision line, or see the inside of the body without using X-rays, and they challenge the idea of camera.
If I take a laser line and turn it up and turn it into a trillion or so, in many farmers to create a package of pictures of just a millimeter wide.
And that picture of pictures, that ball, travel to the speed of light, and again, a million times faster than a common ball.
If we take that bullet and this package of photons and we shoot in this bottle, how do you disperse those photons inside this bottle.
What is the aspect of light in slow camera?
Now, all this --   Remember that all of this happens effectively in less than a nano-starvation is what it takes to travel the light.
But this video is 10 billion times slower so you can see light in motion.
Coca-Cola doesn't apply this research.  You have a lot of things in this movie, and you get this information to show what is going on.
The pulse, our bullet goes into the bottle, with a package of photons that starts to catch it, and that, it starts to wake up.
Part of the light goes up, goes to the table, and we started seeing these conditions.
Many of the photons finally get to the lid and then explode in various directions.
As you can see, there's an air bubble that bounces inside the inside.
In that time, waves travel through the table, and because of the reflections at the top you see at the bottom of the bottle, after several frames -- that the reflections are focused on.
Now, if we take a common and current bullet and make it take the same distance and see it in slow camera at about 10 billion times, how much do you think it would take us to see that film?
One day? A week? Actually, a whole year.
It would be a very boring movie  from a slow bullet ball.
And what about to test with death death?
You can see the waves that come from the table, the tomato and the wall of the bottom.
It's like throwing a stone in a pond.
It's the way nature paints a picture, I thought, from a female at the time, but of course, our eyes see an integral composition of it.
But if you look at this shot, you will realize that, as light is approached from the tomato -- it goes wrong. It doesn't worry.
Why? Because the tomato is mature and the red light inside and it comes back after several billion seconds.
In the future, when this phenomenon is in its mobile phones, they're going to be able to go to the supermarket and check if the fruit is mature without having to touch it.
Why do we create this camera at MIT.
As photographers, you know, if we take a low exhibition picture, it goes very little light.
But we will be a billion times faster than the shortest exposure -- so I just get some light.
We sent that ball -- that package of photons millions of times, and we recorded over and over again with a very atomic synchronization, we took those data of data and compared them to create those females that I showed you.
We can take all of those data in crude and process them exponentially.
Superman can fly.
Other heroes can become invisible.
What if a new power of a supermassive future allows him to see behind the richness?
The idea is that we could throw some light on the door, rebellion, entering the room, a part is going to reflect on the door, and from there to the camera.
Where we could extract those multiple light robots.
It's not science fiction. We already built it.
On the left, it's our female.
Behind the wall there is a manipulation and we will bounce the light on the door.
After the publication of our article in Nature Communications.
And a small fraction of the photons will come back to the camera, but interestingly, in slightly different moments.
And as we have a camera that works that quickly, our female caption, has unique capacity.
It has very good temporary resolution and can look at the world at the speed of light.
So we know the distances to the door and also the hidden objects, but we don't know what extent it corresponds to what a distance.
When you project a laser you can record a picture in broccoli, which, you see on the screen, it doesn't really make any sense.
But let's take lots of images like this, dozens of images, will we bring them together and try to analyze the multiple light robots, and with that, we can see the hidden object of it?
Can we see it in 3D.
This is our reconstruction of us.
We have things to explore before we take this out of the lab, but in the future, we could create cars that avoid collision with what is back to the curve.
Or we could look for survivors in dangerous conditions looking at the reflected light by the open window.
Or we could build the concerned that we can see the inside of the body holding ocean, and the same thing for cartoons.
But of course, because of tissue and blood this is quite difficult, so this is actually a request to scientists so that they start thinking about photographer as a new model of visualization to solve the health problems in the next generation.
Just as Dick Edgal, he was a scientist, he became a science in art, an art of ultraviolet photographs.
I realized that all of the general data that we collected every time are not just for scientific visualization, but we can make it.
Create a new form of computer photography with slow cameras and color code.
And let's look at those waves -- remember, the time between each of those waves is just a few billions of a second.
But here is something funny as well.
If you look at the waves under the ground, these are moving away from us.
The waves should move towards us.
What happens here?
It turns out that, as we're recording almost at the speed of light, we have strange effects. And Einstein would have loved to see this image.
The order that events occur in the world sometimes appear to the camera.
By applying the depression of space and time, we can correct this distribution.
It's time. Thank you.
Hi. This is my mobile phone.
A mobile phone can change life, and it gives you individual freedom.
With a mobile phone can photograph a crime against humanity in Syria.
With a mobile phone, you can take a message and start a protest in Egypt.
With a cell phone, you can record a song, put it to South South and get famous.
This is all possible with a mobile phone.
I'm a chimpanzee of 1984 and live in the city of Berlin.
Let's go back to that moment, to this city.
Here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people protested in search of a change.
This is the 1989 fall of 1989. Imagine if all these people gathered that they were looking for a change, they had a cell phone in the pocket.
Who from the present have a cell phone here?
Look at them.
Raise your mobile phones, you get them."
Look at them. An Andrew, a Black, walk."
It's a lot. Almost everyone today has a mobile phone.
But today I'm talking about me, from my phone, and how life changed me.
I'll talk about this.
These are 35,000 lines of information.
Broader data.
Why is that information there?
Because in the summer of 2006, the E.U. Commission presented a direction.
The data Rendering Direction of data.
This direction says that every European telephone company, every Internet provider from all of Europe, has to store a broad range of information of users.
Who calls who. Who sends an email to whom he sends to.
Who sends a text to whom he sends it.
And if we use the mobile phone, where we are.
All of this information is stored by at least six months, and until two years, in your phone company or your Internet providers.
And all over Europe, people stood up and said, "We don't want this."
They said they didn't want this data retirement.
We want the authority in the digital age, and we don't want the carriers and the Internet providers.
There were lawyers, journalists journalists -- everyone said, "We don't want this."
And here you can see about 10,000 people who came out on the streets of Berlin and said, "Leonardo, I don't fear it."
And some even said this would be the Stage 2000.
The State was the secret police of the East Germany.
And I also asked if this works really, actually.
Can you store all this information on us?
Every time I use the mobile phone?
So I asked my phone phone, Despain Telescope, who at that time was the largest telephone company in Germany, which please would send me all the information that they had about me.
I asked them once, and I went back to ask them, and I didn't get a concrete answer. It was all blah, blah, blah, blank.
But then I said, I want to have this information because you're protecting my life.
So I decided to start a legal demand because I wanted to have this information.
But Desception Telescope said no, we're not going to give you this information.
We finally signed an agreement.
I would retire the demand, and they send me the information that I asked for.
Meanwhile, the German constitutional Transition failed the influence for the German law of the E.U.
So I got this ugly bond with a CD inside.
And in the CD there was this.
Thirty and five thousand acres of information.
At the beginning, I saw them, and I said, well, it's a huge file. Okay.
But after a while, I realized that it's my life.
There are six months of my life in this archive.
It was a little scarcity, what should I do with that?
Because you can see where I am, where the night is, what I'm doing.
But then I said, I want this information to go out.
I want to make it public.
Because I want to show people what the data retention means.
So next to Keith Online and Okay Data City, we did this.
This is a six months from my life.
You can zoom on and off, go back and forward.
You can see every step I give.
And you can see how I go from France in train to colony, and how often I call the traff.
This is all possible with this information.
That's a little scary.
But it's not just about me.
But all of us.
First, there are things like, I call my wife and she calls me, we talk a couple of times.
And then they call me some friends and they call each other.
And then you call the other, and the other one, and we end up with this big network of communication.
You can see how their people communicate each other to what time they call each other, how time they sleep.
You can see all this.
You can see the centers, the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what society is.
If you have access to this information, you can control your society.
This is a model for countries like China and Iran.
This is a model to study the shape of your society, because you know who talks to who, who sent an email to who, all of this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored at least six months in Europe, and until two years.
As I said at the beginning, imagine if all these people on the streets of Berlin in the fall of 1989, they had a cell phone in the pocket.
And the State would have known who was involved in this protest, and, if the State had known who the leaders were, this would never have happened.
The Berlin Wall might never have happened.
And it's not the fall of the iron.
Because today, state agencies and companies want to store as much information from us as possible in and out of the web.
They want to have the possibility to follow our lives and they want to store them forever.
But authority and living in the digital age is not a contradiction.
But today you have to fight by authority.
You have to fight for that every day.
When they go home to tell their friends that privacy is a 21st century value -- and it's not fashionable in fashion.
When they go home, tell her represent that only because companies and state agencies can store certain information, they don't have to do it.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company, what information you store from you.
So in the future, every time you use your mobile phones to remember that you have to fight by authorities in the digital age.
Thank you.
Hello, TEDGlobal, what happens?
It's not enough.
Hello, TEDGlobal, what happens?
I call me Masambles Zap and I'm not drunk, but I know the doctor that brought me into the world.
I cut my mom six times in six different directions, assembly the poor of me in the process.
As a result, I have brain paralysis, so I have a brain paradigm for that.
Look at me.
It's a logic of Shakespeare.
and Muhammad A.
The P. C. It's not genetics.
It's not contaminated can't be contracted.
No one was working the uterus of my mother and I didn't hire it because my parents were prime siblings, although they are.
It only happens by accidents, like the one that happened to me at birth.
Now, I warn you, I'm not an inspiration source.
It feels bad for me, because at some point in life, they've wanted to be disabled.
Let's go from walk.
For Christmas, are you in the commercial center, drive in circles in search of parking and what you see?
16 empty empty places.
And you think, "God, can I be at least a little discovering disabled?
In addition, I tell you, I have 99 problems, and Dr. C. it's just one of them.
If there was an operation, I would win the gold medal.
I'm a Palestinian, Muslim, woman, disabled and alive in New Jersey.
If you don't feel better, maybe you should do it.
I'm from Park Climate, in New Jersey.
I always loved that my neighborhood and my disease had the same initial.
I also love that if I wanted to walk from my house to New York, I could.
Many people with brain paralysis don't walk, but my parents don't believe in the notice."
The mantra of my father was, "You can do it, dance screen."
If my three older sisters clean, I cleaned up.
If my three older sisters were going to public school, my parents were sued to the school system and made sure that I was also going to be, and if we didn't get all the ultimate note all of us in my mother's shoe.
My father taught me to walk at age five years putting my foot on their feet and just walking.
Another tactics that I used was to hang a dollar in front of me to pursue it.
The spring I carry inside was very strong and ...
Yes. The first day in the kindergarten garden was walking like a biomaterial champion that has received a lot of soled.
Growing up, there were only six Arabs in my city, and they were all of the family.
Now there are 20 Arabs -- and they're still all of the family.  I think nobody realized that we weren't Italian.
This was before 9/11, and the politicians would think about using "Dead to Muslims as a campaign.
The people I grew up with didn't have trouble with my faith.
However, it seemed to worry about how much hunger died during the radio.
I told you that I had enough fat to live three months without eating it, so I would keep the dawn of the dawn in the face of it is very easy.
Baker was in Brown.
Yes, in Brooklyn, it's crazy.  My parents couldn't afford physical therapy, so they sent me to dance school.
I learned to dance with tackles, or I can walk with tapes.
I'm from New Jersey, and there we want to be a kid, so if my friends were using tapes, I too.
And when my friends were going to pass the summer vacation on the coast of Jerry, I didn't go.
I spent my summers in a war zone, because my parents feared that if we didn't go back to Palestine all the summer, we became Manhattan.
In the summer vacation often my father was trying to be sandwiched, so I drank screen milk -- I was put hot back in my back, and I got up at the Dead Sea, and I remember the water burned my eyes and I thought, "Would it work."
But the miracle cure was the monkey.
I have to say that it's very boring, but before I make yoga it was a standard of star that I couldn't stand on my foot -- they were able to stand up.
And now I can hold on your head.
My parents refused this idea that I could do anything, that no dream was impossible, and my dream was to be in General Hospital Telescope.
I went to university through positive discrimination, and I got a scholarship for the U.S., University of the state of Arizona, because it was in all the courses.
It was like the mask of the theater department.
Everybody loved me.
I did all the tasks of the least intelligent, I took the ultimate note in my classes and also in your class.
Every time I made a scene from the glass of Christian my teachers crying.
But I never got a role.
Finally, in my last year, the U.S. decided to do a piece called Bangladesh very slow in Jacks.
It's a work of a girl with brain parasites.
I was a girl with brain parasites.
So I started screaming at four singles, "The end will have a paper."
I have brain parasites."
Last free." At the end of the free."
Thank God touching, I am a free."
I didn't get the paper.  And they gave him to Mr. Brown.
I went to increase the theater department, black sticking, as if someone had killed my cat, asking me why, and she told me that because they believed that I couldn't do the risk scenes.
And I said, "Excuse me, if I can't do the risk stunts either.
It was a role that he literally had been born and gave him to an actress without brain paralysis.
The university was mimicking my life.
Hollywood has a serious history of adding actors without disability for disabled paper.
When I graduated graduated, I came home, and my first active tour was a telescope in a television.
My dream was done.
And I knew it would be a "company as "a "company to "Market Camer in a sanitation.
Instead, I went there as a shadow, and I didn't see me more than the new, and it was obvious for me that the repair directors didn't hire a fat action, not white, with disability.
They just hired perfect people.
But there were exceptions to the rule.
I grew up looking at White Gold, Rosetta Barrel, Ellawed, and all these women had one thing in common: they were commercial.
So I made it smoke.
In my first tour, he took famous comics from New York to New Jersey, and I will never forget the face of the first comics that he took when he fell on the realization that he was going to high speed by the New Jersey highway with a driver that had brain parasites.
I worked on clubs across the United States, and also in Arabic in the Middle East, no censor and without video.
Some people say I'm the first monopoly of the Arab world.
I never like to reclaim the first place, but I know you never heard that little unpleasant rumor that says that women are not fun, and they find us very fun.
In 2003, my brother of another mother and father, Dean Obas, and I launched the Republic of New York City in New York, now in his 10.
Our goal was to change the negative image of the American in the media and at the same time remind the reporters of the repair that South and Arabic are not since.
To integrate Arabs was much easier than fighting the challenge of disability.
My great opportunity came in 2010.
I was actually invited by the news news program by cable counts with Keith Orban.
I went into a graduation dance and dragged me to a study and sat in a wheelchair.
I looked at the director and said, "Excuse me, can you give me another single?
She looked at me and said, "Five, four, three, two.
And we were live.
So I went to the desk desk to not get out of the screen during the segment and when I finished the interview, I was painted.
At the end, I had my opportunity and the show -- I knew they wouldn't invite me.
But not just Mr. Olympics came back to me, but it was kind of a full-time participant and I pasted my chair.
Something fun I learned in direct with Keith Obama was that people on the Internet are scary.
It's said that children are criticism, but they never got fun of me or a child or a greater child.
Suddenly, my disability on the Internet became an object object.
I saw online clips with comments like, "Why did I take?
"Is it retrofistic?
And my favorite favorite poor terrorist.
What disease does it have?
We should really hear for it."
A comment suggested even that I would add my disability to my curve, guide, comedian commercial, patience.
Disability is as visual as race.
If someone in wheelchair can't make Ben -- then Berkeley can't make someone on the wheelchair of wheels.
The discoveries are the one. Yes, apply man. Come on.
Discountiles are the largest minority in the world, and the most superimint in the world of entertainment.
The doctors said I wouldn't walk, but I'm here in front of you.
However, I've grown up with the media, I don't think it was.
I hope that together we can create more positive images of disability in media and everyday life.
Maybe if there were more positive images, that would be less hate on the Internet.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we still need all the society to teach our children.
My current journey has led me to very spectacular places.
I got to walk through the flexible red carpet for the daughter of The Telescope Sun Lockey and the bright Arab Brother.
I got to act in a film with Adam Salama and to work with my pain, the incredible Dave Mathematics.
The world collecting the world collecting "The Arabs have become crazy."
I was delivered in representation of the great state of New Jersey at 2008.
And I founded the children of Masham: a beneficial organization to give children Palestinian refugee a single part of what my parents gave me.
It was the only time my father saw me live, and I dedicated this talk to his memory.
(Speeding on peace, paper."
I call me Masambles Zap, and if I can, you can too.
I'd like to tell you a story about a boy of a small village.
I don't know his name, but he knows his story.
It lives in a small village to South Somalia.
This town is near Mozart.
The droughts drive the small village to poverty and the edge of the innovation.
Without anything for him there, it goes to the great city, in this case, Mozart, the capital of Somalia.
When it comes there, there are no opportunities, no work, no future perspective.
He was living in a tent in the city outside of Mozart.
After maybe a year, nothing.
One day you get a gentleman who offered him to take it to lunch, after dinner, to devote.
You know a dynamic group of people, which gives you a disappear.
It gets a little bit of money to buy new clothes, money to send home, to his family.
They present a young man.
And then finally he got home.
It starts a new life.
It has a life goal.
A beautiful day in Mozart, under a blue sky, a car bomb.
That little boy of that little town with the dreams of the great care was suicide terrorism, and that dynamic group of people were to the Shake, a terrorist organization connected to the Qaeda.
So how do the story of a child of a small village trying to fulfill their dreams in the city ends with him instant?
He was waiting.
I was waiting for an opportunity, hoping to start his future, waiting for a future perspective, and this was the first thing he had.
This was the first thing that we call the species period."
And their story is repeated in urban centers around the world.
It's the story of markets, young urban urban young urban displaces in Johannesburg -- they trigger riots in London, who are looking for something beyond the way of waiting."
For young people, the promise of the city, the great dream of the city is the opportunity, of jobs, of well-being, but the young people don't participate in the prosperity of their cities.
It's often the youth that suffers from the highest unemployment rates.
By 2030, three of every five people living in cities will be under 18 years.
If we don't include the young people in the growth of our cities, if we don't give them opportunity, the history of the way of waiting: the therapy of access to terrorism, to violence, to the dancing, to be the history of cities 2.0 to be.
And in my birth, Mozart, 70 percent of the young people are unemployed.
70 percent doesn't work, don't go to school.
They don't do virtually anything.
I went back to Mozart last month, and I went to visit the Maddam hospital, the hospital where I was born.
I remember being in that hospital accumulated by baseballs thinking, and if I had never gone?
What if I'd been forced to be in that same starting spoken?
Would it have become terrorist?
I'm not really sure of the answer.
The reason I was in Mozart that month was actually to address some juvenile leaders in a corporate currency.
I assembled about 90 social juvenile leaders.
We sat and we had a rain of ideas about solutions to the great challenges that the city faces.
One of the young people in the room was Adam.
He went to the University of Mozart, graduated.
There was no work, no opportunity.
I remember when he said to me, because it was a graduate college university, unfortunately, frustrated, was the perfect white for al Shabaab and other terrorist organizations, to be recorded.
They were looking for people like him.
But this story takes a different path.
In Mozart, the biggest obstacle to get from point A to B are the streets.
Venture years of civil war have completely destroyed the visual system, and a motorcycle can be the easiest way to move.
He saw an opportunity and the application.
He started a motorcycle company.
It started to get motorcycles to local residents who normally couldn't buy them.
I bought 10 motors, with the help of his family and friends, and his dream is somewhere to expand hundreds of engines over the next three years.
Why is this story?
What makes this different story?
I think their ability to identify and leverage a new opportunity.
It's business spirit, and I think the business spirit can be the most powerful tool against the specific period."
I fascinated young people to be the creators of economic opportunities that are looking at so desperately as desperately as desperately.
And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs.
I want to talk about a young man who attended one of my meetings, Muhammad Mouaz, a flower.
I was helping me train some of the young people in the summit of corporate initiative and how to be innovative and how to create a culture of business initiative.
In fact, it's the first flower that Mozart has seen in over 22 years, and until a little bit, until Mohamed came in, if you wanted flowers for your wedding.
If you asked someone, "When was the last time you saw fresh flowers and flowers?
For those who grew up during the civil war, the answer would be "not."
So Mohamed saw an opportunity.
It started a flowering company and flower business.
He created a farm on the outskirts of Mozart, and he started growing Tulescope and little little guys, who said, could survive the hard climate of Mozart.
And it started the flower of flowers for body, creating gardens in the houses, and the city companies -- and now it's working on the creation of the world's first public park in 22 years.
There are no public parks in Mozart.
It wants to create a space where the families, the young, can go together, and, as he says, smell the proverbial robots.
By the way, he doesn't grow pink curves because they use a lot of water.
So, the first step is to inspire young people, and in that room, Mohamed presence had a really profound impact in the young.
They had never thought about starting a business.
They had thought about working for an NGO, working for the government, but their story, their innovation, really had a strong impact on them.
I forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity.
I encouraged them to believe that they could be entrepreneurs, that they could be any advantage of change.
By the end of the day, they had innovative solutions for some of the biggest challenges facing the city.
They tried business solutions for local problems.
So inspired young people and creating a corporate spirit culture is really a big step, but young people need capital to make their ideas happen.
They need experience and guidance to guide them in development and put it into their business.
They connect the young people with the resources that they need, bringing the support they need to move from consciousness to creation, and create catalyst for urban growth.
For me, business spirit is something more than starting a business.
It is to create a social impact.
Mohamed is not just selling flowers.
I think it's selling hope.
Their Peace Park -- this is how it calls it, when it's created, transforming the way people see their city.
She hired children from the street to help rent and keep the engines for him.
He gave them the opportunity to escape the paradigm of the way of waiting."
These young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact in their cities.
So my suggestion is: turn the young people into entrepreneurs, come up and feed their inherent innovation, and they will have more stories about flowers and Page Parks than you have and "periodic standards."
Thank you.
I was about 10 years old, and I went to camping up with my dad in the Adam Mountains -- a North area north of the New York state.
It was a beautiful day.
The forest forest.
The sun made the leaves to shine as a virtue, and not to be the way we went on, almost we could pretend that we were the first human beings to spend that land.
We get to our camp.
It was a cooking in a record with a beautiful crystal lake when I discovered something horrible.
Behind the shed there was a bar, of about four square feet with apple hearts.
And I was all angry, and it was very angry, incredibly confused.
The camps that were too lazy to take what they had brought in, who thought they would clean their track?
That question kept with me, and it was just a little bit.
Who clean our base?
No matter how they organize or where do we get the "woman: who clean our trash in Star?
Who clean our trash in Rio or in Paris or in London.
Here in New York, the Department of Santa clean our trash, for 11 thousand tons of waste and two thousand tons of recycled products every day.
I wanted to know as individuals.
I wanted to understand who does that work.
What is it feeling to use the uniform and take that load care?
So I started a research project with them.
I traveled in the trucks and walked through their trajectories and interviewed people in office and facilities across the city, and I learned a lot, but it was still an interrupt.
He needed to go further in.
So I started working as a garbage record.
Now I didn't just travel on the trucks. I drove them.
And it was operating the mechanical schools and the snow stands.
It was a remarkable privilege and an amazing learning.
Everybody asks about smell.
It's there, but it's not as predictable as they believe, and in the days that it's very strong to be used quickly.
It costs a lot to turn to weight.
I met people who had worked on it for several years, and their bodies kept advising the weight of taking on their body tons of garbage every week.
It's also the danger.
According to the World Statistics Office -- the waste collection is one of the most dangerous countries in the country, and I learned the reason.
You're coming out and entering the traffic all day and pass around you.
They just want to happen, so in general, the driver is not paying attention.
That's very bad for the worker.
And also the trash itself is full of dangers that often fall out of the truck and make terrible damage.
I also learned about the relative of garbage.
When you go out of the hill and you see a city from the back of the road, you get to understand that garbage is like a force of nature itself.
It never stops coming.
It's also as a form of breathing or circulation.
It should always be in motion.
And it's also the stigma.
It seems to me that stigma is especially ironic because I think the waste records are the most important workforce in the streets of the city, for three reasons.
They're the first public health protection.
If you don't get rid of the efficient and effective waste every day, this starts to get rid of your container and your inherent dangers are threatened in very real ways.
Disease that we had controlled for decades and centuries come back and start to give us.
The economy needs them.
If we can't get rid of the old thing, we don't have space for what economies in the economy start to fail when it's in danger the consumption.
I'm not advocating for capitalism, just your relationship.
And then there is what I call our average average speed of life.
This is just about the speed that we used to move in the contemporary time.
We usually don't worry about us, we don't repair or clean or take our coffee cup with us, our banks of the liver, our water bottle.
We use them, we throw them, we forget about them, because we know that there's a work force on the other side that will get away from it.
So today I want to suggest to you a couple of ways of thinking about the waste collection that maybe help reduce the stigma and include them in that conversation about how to design a sustainable and human city.
Your work, I think, is almost literature.
They're on the street every day, in a regulation way.
They use a uniform in many cities.
You know when to expect them.
And their work allows us to do our own.
They're almost a form of relief.
The flow that keeps us out of ourselves, from our own waste, our disasters, and that flow should always stay in one way or another.
One day after September 11th, 2001, I heard the band of a waste collection truck on the street, grabbed my little boy and went down the stairs running down, and there was a man doing his rack of paper recycling as he did all the miracles.
And I tried to thank you for doing his work that particular day, but I started crying.
And he looked at me and he just died, and he said, "We're going to be okay.
We're going to be right."
Shortly after that I started researching the waste collection and I went back to that man.
It's called Pauling, we worked together and made good friends.
I want to believe that Paul was right.
We're going to be okay.
But in our efforts for reconciling the way we exist on this planet as a species we have to include and have in account all the costs, even the very real human cost of the labor of labor.
Music waste, what we think we think about when we talk about trash, represent three percent of the waste of the nation.
It's a remarkable statistics.
So in the flow of your days and your lives, the next one you see someone whose job is to clean the garbage of you, to take a moment to recognize them.
Take a moment to tell you thank you.
My work focuses on the connection of thinking about our community life forming part of the environment where architecture naturally born from the conditions and local traditions.
Today I brought two recent projects like this.
Both projects are located in emerging countries, one in Ethiopia and the other in Tunisia.
They also share the fact that different analysis from different perspectives become an essential part of the end of architecture.
The first example started with an invitation to design a commercial center of various floors in Ethiopia, Addis Abraham.
This is the kind of construction that showed us as an example, my team and me, about what we had to design.
At first, the first thing I thought was, "I want to come out run."
After seeing some of these buildings there are many in the city we realized that there are three important aspects of resolve.
In principle, these buildings are almost empty because they have very big stores where people can't afford to buy things.
Second, you need to employ a lot of energy because the research with crystals generates heat inside, so you need a lot of confidence.
In a city where this shouldn't happen because it's a temperate climate that goes from 20 to 25 degrees over the year.
And thirdly, its approach has nothing to do with Africa or Ethiopia.
It's a little bit of a time trying to be so rich in culture and traditions.
In our first visit to Ethiopia, it was really carbonated with the old market that is this structure to the free air where thousands of people, they go and buy things every day to small soldiers.
There is also that idea of using public space to generate external activity.
So I thought, that's what I really wanted to design, not a commercial center.
But the question was how to build a modern building, of various floors, applying these principles.
The next challenge was being presented by inspiring the site, which is located in an area of a lot of growth in the city, where a lot of the buildings that we now see in the image, don't exist.
And it's also between two parallel streets that don't communicate in an extension of hundreds of feet.
So the first thing we did was we created a connection between these two streets, using all the inputs of the building.
And this extends with an unfinished attack that creates a space on the free air in the building that is absolutely, for its own form, of the sun and the rain.
And around this space we've applied the idea of market with small businesses, which changes every floor because of the shape of space.
I also thought, how do you close the building?
I wanted to find a solution that would respond to local climate conditions.
And I started thinking about a similar tissue to a period of foreign shortcut to allow the input of the air, and also the light, but in a filter way.
Then we inspired these beautiful buttons of the external stores.
They have the properties of fractal geometry, and this helped me model the facade, right?
We're building that with these little pre-conditioned pieces that are the windows that let the air happen, and light in a way controlled inside of the building.
This is compared to these little crystals of colors that use the light inside of the building to illuminate the building at night.
With these ideas it wasn't easy to convince the developers because they thought, "That's not a commercial center. It wasn't what we asked for."
But in fact, we all realized that this idea of the market turned out to be much more profitable than the commercial center because they end up with more local to sell it.
And also the idea of the facade was much more economic -- not just because of the material compared to glass, but also because it wasn't necessary to have conditioning air.
So we get certain savings in the budget that we use to implement the project.
The first thing was to think about how to achieve energy consumption for the building in a city in which electricity is nearly every day.
So we got a big advantage by putting photographers on the roof.
And then under those panels we think of the roof as a new public space with meeting areas and bars that would create this urban oasis.
And these ports in the roof, which together collect water for the salts of the inside.
It's expected for the beginning of the next year, because we go through the fifth floor of construction.
The second example is a master plan of 2,000 apartments and services in the city of Tunisia.
And to do such a big project, the biggest thing that I designed, I needed not only to understand the city of Tunisia but also its environment, its tradition and culture.
During that analysis I put a special attention in the middle, a 1,000 years of ancient age that was surrounded by a wall with a dozen access door connected by almost straight lines.
When I went to the place, the first design operation that we did was to expand existing streets by creating 12 interior blocks that are similar to the size and features that there are in Barcelona and other cities in Europe with these patents.
In addition to that, we select some strategic points in relation to the idea of the doors interconnected with straight lines, and this modified the initial model.
And the last operation was to think about the cell, the small cell of the project, like an essential part of the master plan.
I thought, what would be the best orientation.
And it's north, because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house, and therefore a natural window.
So we put a scheme that makes sure most of the apartments are perfectly oriented in that direction.
And this is the result that's almost like a combination of European block and the Arab city.
It has these blocks with pathogens, and then on the low plant we have all the connections for pedestrians here.
And it also responds to local norms that establish greater density on higher levels and a lower density on the low plant.
And it also reinforces this idea of doors.
The roof, which is my favorite space of the project is almost how to restore the community, the space occupied by construction.
It's where all of the neighbors, they can go up and socially, and make activities like running a two miles in the morning, or jumping from a building to another.
These two examples, they have a common approach in the design process.
And also, they're in emerging countries, where you can see cities literally grow.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in people's life changes the communities and local economies at the same pace that the buildings grow.
For this reason, I see even more important to look at architecture looking for simple but affordable solutions, which improve the relationship between the community and the environment and that have a goal to connect nature with people.
Thank you very much.
When I was eight years old, a new girl entered our class. It was so remarkable, as you see all the new girls.
He had huge amounts of hair very bright and a little pencil hit, linear. It was strong for the capital capitals -- very good for the partners.
I ended up that year and I was full of jealousy, until I took my own site plan.
One day I got a time after the school comes out of the school -- I was a little afternoon and I hid in the girls' bathroom.
When the cost was delivered, I went out, I walked into the classroom, I took the table of my teacher the calculation book.
And then, I did.
I altered the ratings of my rivals, just a little bit like this.
All like that.  And I was going to go back to the book, but to see, some of my other partners had very good notes as well.
So in a frankler, I ran the notes around the world, without any imagination.
I put all of the rows to me and myself a row of it, just to be there, because I could.
I'm still surprised what I did.
I don't understand how the idea happened.
I don't understand why I felt good at doing it.
I felt important.
I don't understand why they never caught me.
It was that it was all designed destroying.
I never discovered me.
But above all, I worry about the reason why I was bothered that this little girl, so small, was so good for photography.
I was intrigued by the celes.
They're so mysterious and so penning.
We know that babies suffer from celess.
Also, the primates, the blue birds are very proud.
We know that the skies are the number one cause of children in the United States.
And yet, I've never seen a study that analyzes loneliness or long duration or sadness.
So you have to go to fiction, because the novels are like the lab in which the cells study in all their possible shapes.
In fact, I don't know if it's an exaggeration to say that if there were no jealousy, there would be no literature.
Well, there would be no Helen infinity, there would be no "Office."
There would be no hair and no "The 1,000 and a night."
There would be no Shakespeare.
They would disappear.
Without jealousy, there is no Prosecult -- I know it's fashionable to say that Project has the answers for everything, and in terms of the jealousy, almost that they have it.
This year was 100 years of their master work, "In pursuit of the longer time, the most exhibiting study of sexual celess, and also the ordinary competition, my own, everything we could have.  And thinking about Project, we have the senses of it, right?
We think of a child trying to reconcile sleep.
We think of a magical man in your landing.
We forget how hard that image.
We forget what it is.
I mean, it's about books that Virginia Boyle said were as hard as cat trip.
I don't know what the cat triple is, but we assume it's supervisor.
Let's see why they go so well together, the novel and the celebrations, the celess and Project.
Is it going to be very obvious like the celess, who are reduced to the person, to their wish, to their individuals, are a very solid narrative base?
I don't know. I think we get very close to the bone, when we think about what happens when we feel celebrates.
When we feel jealousy, we tell ourselves a story.
A story about other people's lives, and those stories make us feel terrible because they're designed to make us feel wrong.
Being at the time storytelling and audience, we know exactly what details will include to get the knife up, right?
The cells make us all amateur novels, and that's something that I proposed understood.
All that she does to give me pleasure could give us pleasure to another, maybe right now."
And it starts to tell itself that story, and since then, I tried to say that every particular love that Sang detected in its love, adds it to its collection of torture instruments in its private camera.
You have to admit that Shanghai and Project, they were notoriously celebrates.
You know, Project Novembers would have to leave the country, if they wanted to break with it.
But you don't have to be so color to recognize that it's a tough job. Right?
The skies are adoption.
It's a hungry emotion. You have to feed it.
And what are the celes?
The cells are born from information.
The cells use the details.
The cells like the large amounts of bright hair and the cute little story of pencil pictures.
The skies are born from the photos.
That's why Instagram is so successful.  I tried to line the language right with the celebrations.
When Shanghai is in its skin zone, suddenly listening to behind the doors and bribe the services of their lover and then defend those behavior.
He says, "Look, I know that you think this is reputation, but it's not different than the interpretation of an old text or to look at a monument.
He says, "It's scientific research with real intellectual value.
Projector is trying to prove that the cells look intelligent, and they make us seem absurd, but in their mind, they are search for knowledge, search of truth, a painful truth. In fact, to what Proust Congoration, the more painful the truth, the better.
The pain, the humiliation -- the loss, the losses -- these were the pathways to Project wisdom.
He says, "A woman who we need, that makes us suffer in us a much deeper sense of feelings and vital sense than a wise man who can be interested in us.
Is it telling us that we're going to look for crimes for crimes?
No. I think it's trying to say that the cells reveal us.
Is there any other emotion that makes us open in this particular way?
Is there any other emotion to us our agriculture, our horrible ambition and our rights?
Is any other emotion that taught us to look at so perfectly intentionally?
Freud writing about this later.
One day, Freud was visited by a young man who was consumed with the idea that his woman would get it.
And Freud says that there was something weird in that man, who didn't look at what his wife did.
It was innocent -- everybody knew it.
The poor creature was under suspended without any cause.
But he looked for things that did his wife, without realizing -- involuntary behaviors.
Does it sound too much, or does it accidentally come with a man?
Freud says that the man was becoming a curve of the unconscious of his wife.
The novels are very good at this.
The novels describe very well how the cells do to look at intensity, but without precision.
In fact, the more intensely we are, the more we become a fantasy of fantasy.
And because of this reason, I think, celebrates us to make violent or illegal acts of it.
The cells drive us to behave in a completely imaginary way.
Now I'm thinking about me at age eight, I recognize it, but I'm also thinking about this story that I heard in the news.
A woman in Microsoft from 52 years old was captured by having created a fake account on Facebook from the one that was sent visitors -- awful messages for a year.
For a year.
She was trying to instill the new girlfriend of his boys -- I have to confess that when or this, they reacted to administration.
Because let's be realistic.
What huge, although unfortunately, creativity. Right?
It's like novel.
Like a High Highway novel novel.
Hygraphican is one of my favorites.
She's a very strange and brilliant character of American literature.
It's the author of "The Extra in a Transit and "The Talk Marter: Richard: books that are dealing with our minds and confuse our minds, and once we are in the sphere, in the realm of jealousy, the membrane that separates what it might be, can be profiled in a second.
Take Tom Richard, its most famous character.
Tom Richard is going to want to want or want what you have to get away from you to be and get out of what you ever had, and it's under the floor. It responds to your name, it takes your rings, it takes your bank accounts.
It's a way.
But what do we do? We can't take Tom Richard route.
I can't give you all the world, as much as I sometimes want.
It's a lesson, because we live in time of envy.
We live in time times.
I mean, we're good citizens of social media, where is it the sending of the sound, right?
The novels show us the sale? I'm not sure.
So we're going to do what the characters always do when they're not sure, when they're to a mystery.
Let's go to Bay Street of Baker Street and ask Steret Hollywood.
When people think about Hollas, they think about the malaria Professor at Medical Professor that criminal genius.
But I've always preferred the "Archimed Council: the head face of School Yard who needs Hollywood desperately needs the Hungary genius, but it was annoyed by it.
Oh, it sounds so familiar to me.
Letter needs his help, but the residential, and the residential bubble in the each mysteries of the mystery.
But as they work together, something starts to change, and finally in "The Six National Advance: once Hollywood comes in, they go back to all of their solution, Lego goes back to Hollywood and says, "We're not celebrates, Mr. Hollywood.
We're proud of you."
And he tells him that there's no person in Scott Yard who would not want to shake your hand.
It's one of the few times we see Hollywood transplanted in history. It looks like this very emotional. That scene is also mysterious, right?
It seems to treat the cells as a problem of geometry, without emotion.
You know, in a Milky minute is on the opposite side of Lesterland.
The next minute are on the same side.
Suddenly, Lesterland is allowed to admire that idea of being the present.
Could it be so simple?
What if the cells are really a issue of geometry, just a question of where we allow us to be relative to the other?
Well, maybe we don't have to show us from the excellence of the other.
We can align with it.
But I like control plans.
So as we expect that to happen, we remember that we have the fiction to comfort us.
Just the fiction of the chicken is demonstrating.
The fiction used to be invited to the table.
And look at what you get that superintelligence? The sweet Lester, the Tarker Rita, the crazy Shanghai, the same Marc Project.
We're in excellent company.
Thank you.
We used to solve big problems.
On July 21, 1969, Buzz Aldrin jumped out of the moon of Apollo 11 and went down about the Marine Mars.
Armstrong and Aldrin were alone alone, but their presence in the moon surfaces was the culmination of a compelling collective process.
The Apollo program was the largest movement in peace times in American history.
To get to the moon, NASA spent about 180 billion dollars today, or four percent of the federal budget.
The Apollo gave work at about 400,000 people and asked the collaboration of 20,000 companies, universities and government agencies.
They died people, including the track of Apollo 1.
But before the Apollo Finger, 24 men traveled to the moon.
Twelve walked on their surface, which It was all about the death of Armstrong last year, is now the old one.
So why did they go?
They didn't bring a lot of them back, 360 pounds of old rock, and something that 24 would be able to be affecting later, a new sense of the small and the fragility of our common home.
Why were they? The cynical answer is that they were because President Kennedy wanted to demonstrate the Soviets that this nation had better rockets.
But the words of Kennedy at the University of Richard in 1962, give us a better idea.
John F. Kennedy: Some ask, why the Monthon?
Why would it turn into our goals?
And you might also ask, why do you climb the highest mountain together?
35 years ago, why would you fly on the Atlantic?
Why does it play Richard against Texas?
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon in this decade, and do other things, not because they're simple, but because they're hard.
Jason Panteel," for the contexts, the Apollo was not just a victory of the West on the Cold War.
In the time, the strongest emotion was to wonder to the transmission of the power of technology.
They were because it was great to be able to do it.
The landing in the moon happened in a context of a long list of technological trials.
The first half of the 20th century produced the assembly line and plane, penicillin and vaccine for tuberculosis.
In the middle of the century, the politicians and the smallpox.
Technology seemed to get what Alvin Top in 1970 called active force."
For most of the history of humanity, we couldn't go faster than a horse, or a back bar, but in 1969, the Apollo 10 to 40,000 miles /
Since 1970, no human being has come back to the moon.
No one has traveled faster than the trip of Apollo 10, and the joy of optimism about the power of technology has been evaporated by seeing that problems that we imagine that technology would solve how to go to Mars, create a clean energy, cure cancer, or feed the global population seem to be intractable results.
I remember seeing the Apollo 17th sports.
I was five years old, and my mother told me not to look at the lift tube called the Saturday Viet rocket.
I really knew that this would be the last mountain mission, but I was completely sure I would come to see the colonies on Mars.
So that from something happened to our ability to solve problems with technology has become a common place.
We hear it all the time.
We've heard it for the last two days here, at TED.
It looks like the technologists had been distracted and recorded with trivial toys, things like iPhone, applications and social networks, or algorithms that accelerate the automated sales.
There's nothing wrong in most of these things.
They've expanded and enriched our lives.
But they don't solve the big problems of humanity.
What happened?
There is a radical explanation in Silicon Valley, who trust that they've created less ambitious companies than those of the years in which Intel were funded -- Microsoft, Apple and General.
Silicon Valley says that markets are cultures, in particular, the incentives that risk capitalists offer to companies.
Silicon Valley says that risk investment caused the creation of transformative ideas for the funding of incremental problems or even false problems.
But I don't think this explanation is good enough.
It explains mostly what's going wrong in Silicon Valley.
Even when the risk capitalists were in their sharp point without worrying about risk, they preferred small investments -- tiny investments that they could go out in 10 years.
The Christians. They've always had problems to invest with benefits in technologies as energy, which need a huge capital and what development is in the long term. They haven't invested in developing technologies to solve big problems because they don't have an immediate commercial value.
No, the reasons why we can't solve big problems are more complicated and deeper.
Sometimes, we chose not to solve big problems.
We could go to Mars if we wanted to.
NASA has even designed a plan.
But going to Mars would require a political decision that is popular, and that will never happen.
We're not going to go to Mars because everybody thinks there are things more important than doing on Earth.
Sometimes, we can't solve big problems because political systems fail.
Today, less than two percent of global energy consumption comes from renewable energy sources like sunlight, wind and biomaterial -- less than two percent, and the reason is completely cheap.
Carbon and natural gas are cheaper than solar and wind, and oil is cheaper than biomaterial.
We want some alternative energy sources that can compete in price. They don't exist.
Now, the technologists and the entrepreneurs and the economists agree about what policies and international treaties would incentivize the development of alternative energy, mostly a significant increase in research and energy development, and some kind of control of the price of the coal.
But there's no hope in the political climate that we will see an energy policy of America or international treaties that reflect that consensus.
Sometimes the big problems that seem to be technological -- they are not going to be.
We know for a time that famines are results of failure in the food repair.
But 30 years of research have taught us that famines are political crisis that affects the distribution of food.
Technology can improve things like harvest or systems for storage and food repair -- but there will be famines while there were bad governments.
Finally, big problems sometimes get a solution because we don't understand the problem really.
President Nixon declared the cancer war in 1973, but we soon discover that there are many kinds of cancer, which is some terribly resistant residents to treatment, and only in the last 10 years, they seem to have found effective and viable treatments.
Hard problems are hard.
It's not true that we can't solve problems with technology.
We can and we should, but these four elements have to be presented: political leaders and the population must want to solve the problem, institutions must actually support the solution. It must actually be treated from a technological problem, and we need to understand it.
The Apollo mission, which has become something like a metaphor for the ability of technology to solve big problems, with those criticisms.
But it's a deep model in the future.
We're not in 1961.
There is no gay competition as in the Cold War, there is no policy like John Kennedy who wound the hard and the dangerous and there's no science mythology of science fiction like exploring the solar system.
In general, going to the moon turned out to be simple.
It was just three days.
And really, I wasn't even solving any problem.
We're alone in our present, and the solutions of the future will be harder to get.
God knows that we don't lack the challenges.
Thank you very much.
OK, I'm going to talk about trust, and I'm going to start remembering the widespread ideas that you have about trust.
They're so common that they've become clicks of our society.
I think it's three.
The first one is a record, there's been a huge decline of trust, it's a very widespread belief.
The second is a goal, we should have more trust.
And the third is a task: we should recover trust.
I think the record, the goal and the task have been wrong.
What I'm going to try to tell you today is a different story about a record, a goal and a task, which I think gives a more clear idea about the subject.
First of all, why do people think trust has dispersed?
And if I think about the basis of my own evidence, I don't know the answer.
I will think that it can have declined in some activities or institutions and that could have increased in others.
I don't have it.
But I can go to the opinion polls and the opinion polls are supposedly the source of the belief that trust has decreased.
When you look at the opinion polls over time, there aren't many evidence of it.
I mean, the people who were discovered about 20 years ago, mostly journalists and politicians, continue to inspire the same discovery.
And the people who were very reliable about 20 years ago are still quite reliable, judges, nurses.
The rest of us are in the middle, and by the way, the average citizen on the street is almost exactly half a way.
But is this evidence enough?
What the opinion polls record are, of course, opinions.
What else can you do?
What you see is generic attitudes that people manifest when they ask certain questions.
Does it trust politicians in the policies?
Now, if someone would ask you, "Do you trust the vegetable?
Do you trust fisheries?
Consumers on elementary teachers in elementary teachers?
You probably start to ask yourself, to do what?
And that would be a very sensible answer.
And you might say, when you've answered your question, "Well, I trust some of them, but in other nothing."
It's very rational.
Ultimately, in real life, we tend to break trust in a different way.
We don't assume that the level of confidence we're going to feel for a certain type of office, functional or kind of person, is going to be uniform in all cases.
I could, for example, say that I trust a certain primary teacher that I know to give the reading class, but in any way to drive the school microbes.
After all, I could know that it wasn't a good driver.
I could trust my youngest friend to keep a conversation, but no, maybe to keep a secret.
Simple.
And if we've got those evidence in our everyday lives in the way that trust is different, why do we stop all that knowledge when we think about trust more abstract way?
I think the surveys are very bad tools to measure the real level of real trust, because they try to open the good judgment to the fact of trusting something or somebody.
Second, what about the goal?
The goal is to have more confidence.
And frankly, I think it's a stupid goal.
It's not the goal that I would say.
I'm going to try to have more confidence in what is meaningful of trust, but not what it is.
Ultimately, I'm a fan of not trusting what it's not reliable.
And I think that those people who spread their savings with the very appropriately named Mr. Madama, who then disappeared with them, I think about them, and I think, well, yes, they were too confident.
Having more confidence is not an intelligent goal in this life.
It confidence deployment or negative confidence, that's the right target.
Once you say that, it says, yes, it means that what matters first is not trust, but trustworthiness.
What is about making a judgment about how reliable people are in certain ways.
And I think that in order to make a trial, we're forced to focus on three things.
Are they competitions? Are they honest? Are they responsible?
And if we find that one person is competing in the part of the personal, and it's responsible and honest, then we will have a very good reason to trust it, because it's going to be worthy of trust.
But if, in contrast, they're not responsible for it, we couldn't trust them.
I have friends who are competent and honest, but it won't trust them to take a letter to the mail because they're offensive.
I have friends who are very sure they can do certain things, but I see that they overestimate their own competition.
And I'm very glad to say that I think I don't have a lot of friends who are competent and responsible but extremely destiny.
If I look like this, I still haven't signed up.
But that's what we're looking for, trustworthiness.
The trust is the answer.
The trustworthiness.
And of course, it's hard.
In the last few decades, we've tried to build accounts of accounts for all kinds of institutions, professionals, functions and so on, that make us easier to judge their trustworthiness.
Many of those systems have had the opposite effect.
They don't work as they should.
I remember once I was talking to a party and said, "Well, you see, the problem is that it takes more time to do the administrative paper than assisting the piece in you."
And we found the same problem in all of our public lives, and institutions, that the accountability system that is destined to ensure conflict and trustworthiness.
What they do is they do the work of the people who have to do hard tasks, like the parts.
I sure you all know similar examples.
All of that, for the target.
I think the goal should be more confidence, and that things would be different if we try to be worthy of trust, and we will transmit the people that we are reliable and if other people are trying to determine whether other people, officials or politicians are worthy of trust.
It's not easy. It's the trial, the simple actions, the attitudes, which is not done properly.
Third, the task.
To call the task to rebuild trust, it puts things into the ocean.
It suggests that you and I should rebuild trust.
Well, we can do it with ourselves.
We can reconstruct a little bit of trustworthiness.
We can do it if they're two people, together, trying to improve trust.
But trust -- in definition, is different because we give it other people.
You can't reconstruct what other people have given you.
You have to give them the enough basis so they can trust you.
You have to be worthy of trust.
And that, of course, because you can't get up, usually all people, all the time.
But you also have to get rid of the things that you're worthy of trust.
How do you do that?
You do that every day, everywhere, it does the common people, the functional, the institutions, very effectively.
I'll give you a simple commercial example.
The store where I buy my socks says that I can give them back without giving them.
I take them and give me the money, or change them for the color I want.
That's great. I trust them because they became vulnerable to me.
I think there's a great lesson in that.
If you get vulnerable to the other part, that's a very good proof that you're worthy of trust, and you have confidence in what you're saying.
So at the end, I think what we're pointing out is not something very difficult to discover.
What people trust is the relationships, and in that framework, they can determine when and how the other person is worthy of trust.
Thank you.
From the beginnings of computers we've been striving to reduce the separation between us and digital information, the separation between our material world and the world of the screen where the imagination can be discovered.
This separation has been reduced, increasingly, and more, to such a point that today is less than one millimeter, the smell of the glass of a tactile screen, and the power of computing has become accessible to all.
But I ask myself, and if there were no barriers?
So I started imagining what it would be.
And first of all, I created this tool that goes into digital space, so that when you get it strong against the screen to transfer your physical body to pigs.
Designers can kill their ideas directly in 3D, and surgeons can practice with virtual organs underneath the screen.
So with this tool the barriers break down.
But the two hands remain still out of the screen.
How do you get inside and interact with digital information using all the dexterity of your hands?
In the Apple Science division of Microsoft, along with my mentor Cathed Bonobuin, it reduces the computer and transformed a little space on the keyboard in a digital area of work.
Combining a transparent bombsight with depth cameras to detect the fingers and the face, you can now raise the hands of the keyboard, get inside the 3D space, and grab pixels directly with your hands.
Like windows and archives have a location in real space, select them is as easy as to grab a book of a shelf.
You can run the book and turn out lines or words with the virtual tactile sensor that is down from every floating screen.
Architects can stretch or rotate their machines directly with hands.
In these examples, we entered the digital world.
What if we invest the papers and make digital information come to us?
In fact, many of us will have bought and showed things on the Internet.
Now that doesn't have to worry about.
What I have here is a virtual test on the Internet.
This is the vision that you get from a device mounted in your head or you train when the system understands the geometry of your body.
If we take this idea further, I thought, instead of just seeing pixels in space, how can we make them physical so that we can touch them and feel it?
What would a future look like?
At MIT Media Lab with my tutor Hiroshi HIV and my collaborator, Red Post, we created this only physical piece.
This spherical magnet is behaving as a 3D pixel in space, which means that the computer as users can move the object anywhere inside this little three-dimensional space.
Symmetrically, what we did was we had the gravity announced and control the movement through a combination of magnetic levitation and mechanical depletion and detectors.
And by programming the object, we release it from the constraints of time and space, which means that human movements can record and go back and stay forever in the physical world.
You can teach pheromones physically and distance and famous size of Michael Jordan, you can reproduce as a physical reality, the times we want.
Students can use it as a tool to understand complicated concepts like the movement of planets, the physics, and unlike the monitors or text books, this is a real and palpable experience that you can play and feel. It's very powerful.
But what's more fascinating than changing the physical part of the computer is to imagine how to program the world is going to change our everyday physical activities.
As you see, digital information is not just going to show us something but to start acting directly on us as part of the physical world around us without that we have to get rid of our world.
We started talking about today talking about a barrier, but if we suppress that barrier, the only limit that stays is our imagination.
Thank you.
I was trained to become a great man for two years in Hungary, China, in the 1970s.
When I was in the first grade, the government wanted to transfer to a school for athletes with all of the paid passengers.
But my mother tiger said, "No."
My parents wanted me to become engineering, like them.
After surviving the Cultural Revolution, it firmly believed that there was only one side path towards happiness -- a safe and good job.
No matter whether the work would like or not.
But my dream was to be a Chinese spot.
This was me, in my imaginary piano.
A singer singer has to start training from very young to learn the activists, so I tried everything I could to go to the opera school.
I wrote to the director of school and the prostitute of a radio program.
But no adult would get the idea.
No adult took me seriously.
Only my friends were supported me, but they were kids, without authority, like me.
So at the age of 15, I knew that it was too much bigger to train.
My dream would never be done.
I feared that during the rest of my life a second class happiness is the only thing I could aspire for.
And this was so unfair.
So I resolved to look for another voice.
Nobody around me wanted to teach me? Okay.
It turned to books.
Complex boxes of Samalay, "The Edit "The Child "The History of Now Haiti Camera in 1995, and what were the first books that I read here?
Those who were banned in China, of course.
Good Earth." It's about Chinese championship life.
And it's not propaganda. I understand.
The Bible is interesting, but strange.
That's a topic for another day.
But the fifth commandment for me was a revelation: "Make your father and your mother."
"Henger: I said, "It's so different, and much better than opening."
So it became my tool to get out of this guilt cubic trap and to reset the relationship with my parents.
The encounter with a new culture also gave rise to my computer reading.
It creates a lot of perspectives.
For example, at the beginning this map seemed to me out of place because this is what students in China learn.
I had never occurred to me, that China didn't have to be in the middle of the world.
A map involves people's perspective.
Compassion reading is not new.
It's a common practice in the academic world.
There are to research fields like comparative religion and comparative literature.
Compare and contrast, it offers the academics a deeper understanding of a subject.
And I thought that if the comparative reading worked to research, why not do it in everyday life?
So I started reading books from two.
You can treat people "But Walker Sanitary "Jesus" "Jescan Adams?
For the Crisis, the temptation is economic, policies and spiritual.
For the Buddha, they're all psychologists? It started, fear and social shoulder. Interesting.
If you know another language, it's also fun to read your favorite books in two languages.
Charles Territe Trick Thomas Territes "The Tar Car Career: Allian Watson instead of losing in translation. I found that you can win a lot of it.
For example, it's through the translation that I realized that happiness in Chinese literally means "a quick sleep."
And "Nover in Chinese, it literally means new mother."
The books opened me a magic door to connect with people from the past and the present.
I know I'm not going to feel alone or powerless ever.
Having a developed dream is really not compared to what many others have suffered with.
I've come to believe that reality is not the only purpose of a dream.
Their most important purpose is to connect with the place of dreams, where the passion comes from, where happiness comes from.
Even a destine dream can do that for you.
And it's because of the books, which I'm here, happy, living again with purpose and clearly, most of the time.
So the books are always getting them.
Thank you.
Thank you.  Thank you.
When I was in my 20s, I saw my first client of psychology.
I was a documentary student in clinical psychology.
She was a 26-year-old woman called Alex.
Alex walked into the first session using cowboy and a hungry towel, and he threw up in my office of my office took off the shoes and told me he wanted to talk about his problems with men.
When I heard this, I felt so alive.
My class of class had a dog as a first client client.
And I got a very nice fan that I wanted to talk about men.
I thought I could handle it.
But I didn't.
With the stories that Alex brought to the sessions, it made me easy just to move the head while we brought the solution.
"The tropical are the new penny," he said, Alex, and so I saw, she was right.
You start working afterwards, you get home later, you have children later, even death happens later.
For veterinarians like Alex and I had a little bit of time.
But shortly after, my superconductor press me to press Alex to talk about his loving life.
I was resistant.
I said, "Sure, it's coming out with guys under your category -- you get it up with a hollow head, but it's not like it was going to marry him."
And then my superconductor said, "Not no, but maybe it married the next one.
In addition, the best time to work on the Alexander marriage is before it gets happened."
This is what psychologists call a "The "American moment.
It was when I realized that the 30 are not the new 20.
Yes, people feel head after what was used to, but this didn't make the 20 of Alex be a pause in their development.
This made that the 20 of Alex were the perfect moment, and we were wasting it.
So I realized, that this kind of benign religion was a real problem and had real consequences, not just for Alex and his loving life, but for the careers, the families and the future of selections everywhere.
There are 50 million people in the United States, today.
This means 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent if you consider that nobody gets to adulthood.
Raise your hand if you're in your 20.
I want to see the self-assembled here.
Oh, yeah. They're amazing.
If you work with seven, you love a selection, you remove the dream a selection, I want to see -- it's okay. Amazing. The really important people matter.
This is not just my opinion. These are the facts.
We know that 80 percent of the key moments in life will happen at 35 years.
This means that eight of every 10 decisions and experiences and times "Ala" -- which shape your life will have happened to when you have 30 and so on.
People from more than 40, they don't go into panic.
This audience is going to be good, I think.
We know that the first 10 years of a career have an exponential impact about how much money they will win.
We know that more than half Americans are married, they live or they're going out with their future partner at 30 years.
We know that the brain ends up its second and last growth stage in its 20s and it is reproductive for adults, which means that if there's something that wants to change itself, now it's time to change it.
We know that personality.
The 20 are the time to educate about their body and their options.
When we think about the development of the child, we all know that the first five years are crucial for language and attachment in the brain.
It's a moment where your daily and common life has an impact in the person that will become a person.
But what we don't hear often is there's something called adult development and our 20s are a critical moment in adult development.
But this is not what the selections are listening.
newspapers talk about changes on the timeline.
The researchers call the 20th an extended adolescence.
The journalists are taking ridiculous names to the selections like "Textings and "Titanics."
It's true.
As a culture, we've considered a transition what is actually the decade that defines adulthood.
Leonardo Berkeley said that to achieve big things, you need a plan and not enough time.
Isn't it?
What do you think it happens when you give a band on your head and say, "Do you have another 10 years to start your life?
Nothing happens.
They stole that person the sense of urgency and ambition and not absolutely anything.
And then every day, smart self-states, interesting like you or your children and daughters get to my office and say something like this: "I know my girlfriend is not good for me, but this relationship. I'm just killing time."
Or they say, "Everybody says that as you start a career before the 30, everything will be right."
But then it starts ringing something like this: "My 20s are just going to finish and I still have nothing to show you.
I had better subject the day I graduated from college.
And then it starts ringing something like this: "My quotes during the 1920s, they were like the chairs.
They all run and they were fun, but then at some point around the '30s, the music came out, and they all started sitting down.
I didn't want to be the only one who would be stopped with, so sometimes I think I married my husband because he was the nearest chair when I was 30.
Where are the self-assembled here?
Don't do that.
Well, that sounds a little extreme, but it's not wrong, the risks are very high.
When you leave a lot of things for the '30s, there's a huge pressure to the tropical and so many of you to start a career, pick up a mate, and you have two or three children in a much more short period of time.
Many of these things are not compatible -- and there are research that starts to show -- which is much more difficult and stressful to do everything in the 1930s.
The media crisis crisis is not about buying red sports cars.
It's about realizing that you can't have the career you want now.
Realizing you can't have the son you want now, or you can't give a brother to your son.
A lot of tribes and curious people see themselves, and to me, sitting in the room, and they talk about their 20, "What was I doing? What was I thinking?"
I want to change what the selections are doing and thinking.
Here's a story about how it might be.
It's a story about a woman called Emma.
At the age of 25, Emma came to my office because I was, in his own words, having a crisis of identity.
He said he would like to work in art or entertainment, but he still couldn't decide, so he spent the last few years working as a teacher.
As I was cheaper, I lived with a girlfriend that showed more early than ambition.
And despite living about 20 very difficult, his previous life had been even more difficult.
He cried often in our sessions, but then she was lifted by her saying, "You don't choose your family, but you can choose your friends."
Well, one day Emma got his head on his legs and cried for almost every hour.
I had just bought a new book for director, and he had spent the entire morning by filling it with his many contacts, but then he was looking at the empty space that followed after the words "In "And "Paradox, please.
I was at the point of the story when he saw me and said, "Who's going to be for me if I have a car accident.
Who's going to take care of me if I get cancer?
At that time, I got a lot of work to resist and not say, "My."
What Emma needed was not a textbook that was really worried about.
Emma needed a better life, and I knew this was his opportunity.
I had learned a lot since I worked with Alex as to just sit while the decision decade of Emma was going on.
So over the next weeks and months, I told Emma three things that all seven, man or woman, deserves to know.
First of all, I said to Emma that would forget that identity crisis and get identity capital.
For identity capital, I mean doing something that adds value to your person.
Doing something that is an investment in what they want to be later.
I didn't know the future of the Emmally career, and nobody knows the future of work, but I know this: identity of identity makes identity.
So now it's time for that work on the other side of the country, of that interior, of that company that you want to test.
I'm not slowing up the vertical exploration, I'm disappearing the exploration that I shouldn't count, which, by the way, is not exploration.
It's processing.
I said to Emma that I would explore jobs and make them tell you.
Second, I said to Emma that urban tribes are survived.
The best friends are excellent to take you into the airport, but the self-assembled self-explorate friends are limited to who you know what you know, how they think, how they talk, and where they work.
That new piece of capital, that new person who will come out almost always comes from their closest circle.
New things come from what they're called a weak friend's friends of friends.
Yes, half of the self-assembled have a bad job or they don't have work.
But the other half no, and the weak ties are the way we can take this group.
Half of the jobs created never published, then knowing the boss of your neighbor is the way to get a job not published.
It's not cheating. It's the science of how information happens.
Finally, but not least, Emma believed that you don't choose your family, but you know your friends.
This was true when I was growing up, but as a verbal, Emma soon will choose his family, when he has a partner and shapes his own family.
I said to Emma that the time to choose his family had arrived.
You might think that 30 is better age to sit head than 20 or even 25, and I agree with you.
But to choose the person that you live with now or take you now when everyone on Facebook, they start walking towards the altar.
The best time to work in your marriage is before you have it, and that involves being as intentional in love as you're at work.
To choose your family has to be a conscious choice of who and what they want instead of just making it work or kill time with whom it is to choose you.
So what happened with Emmally?
Well, we looked at that direction, and she found the roommate of a cousin that worked on an art museum in another state.
This weak link helped him get a job there.
That work supply gave him a reason to leave the boyfriend that he lived with.
Now, five years later, it's special organization of events.
This is a man who chose consciously consciously.
I love his new career, love his new family, and I sent a letter that said, "Now the space contact spaces are not big enough.
Emma story can sound easy, but that's what I love to work with seven.
It's very easy to help you.
The selections are like airplanes who come out of the Los Angeles airport. They go somewhere in the West.
Just before the disappear, a slight adolescent in its trajectory makes the difference between landing in Alaska or in Fire.
In the same way, at 21 or at 25 and even at the age of 24, a good mess, a good mess, a good TED Talk can have huge effects in the next few years or even in the next generation.
This is my idea worthy of spreading all the self-assembled ones that you know.
It's as simple as what I learned to tell Alex.
That's what I now have the privilege of telling you to self-states like Emma every day, the trouble are not the new 20, they raise their adults, they get the identity capital, they use their weak bonds to choose your family.
Don't let me define why they didn't know or what they didn't do.
They're deciding their life today.
Thank you.
When I was 27 years old, I left a very demanding work in management consumer for a job that was even more example: the documentary.
I went to show you mathematics to seventh grade students in New York Public schools.
And as any professor, I apply tests and testing.
I give them tasks.
When the work comes back, I calculated the grades.
What I called the attention was that the E.U. wasn't the only difference between my best and my worst students.
Some of those who had a better performance had no contact of I.Q.
Some of my smartest kids were not going so well.
And that made me think.
The kind of thing that you need to learn in math in seventh grade, safe, are difficult, proportions, democracy, the area of a paralyzed.
But these concepts are not impossible and was very convinced that every one of my students could learn the lesson if they were working hard and during enough time.
After several years of documentary, I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a better understanding of students and learning from a motivation perspective, from a psychological perspective.
In education, the only thing we know how to measure a better way.
It's the C. But what if you succeed in school and in life depends on much more than the ability to learn in fast and easy ways.
So I left the classrooms and I went to college to become a psychologist.
I started studying kids and adults in all kinds of challenging scenarios, and in every study my question was, who has success here and why?
My research team and I went to the Military West Post.
We tried to predict what networks stay in the military training and who would be returned.
We went to the National Conference of Deletability, and we tried to predict what children are going to move away in the competition.
We study non-sharp teachers working on really difficult neighborhoods, asking us what teachers will still be teaching for the end of the school year and those who will be the most effective in improving the results of their students.
We partnered with private companies, wondering what of these marketers are going to keep their job position?
And who is going to make more money?
In all those very different contexts, it emerged a feature as a very important prediction of success.
And it wasn't social intelligence.
It wasn't the good appearance, the physical health and not the E.U.
It was the determination.
The determination is passion and perseverance.
The determination is to have resistance.
The determination is to cling to its future, day after day, not just the week, not just for the month, but for years and working really hard to make that future a reality.
The determination is to live life as if it was a marathon, not a career at all.
A few years ago, I started studying the determination in public schools.
I asked thousands of high school students to make my determination, and then wait about more than a year to see those who were grateful.
It turns out that the children with more determination had significantly greater likely to graduate even when I packaged them in every characteristic that I could measure, things like family income, the results of standardized testing, even the security that children felt when they were in school.
So it's not only in West Polisc or at the National Conference of Delamit in which the determination is -- it's also in school, especially for children in risk of getting it.
For me, the most shocking thing about determination is how little we know, how little science knows about its development.
Every day, parents and teachers ask me, "How do I develop the determination in children?
What should I do to teach kids a ethical solid solid."
How do you keep them out for the long term?
The most honest answer is: I don't know.  And what I know is that talent doesn't give you determination.
Our data shows very clearly that there are many talented individuals that are simply not going ahead with their commitment.
In fact, in our data, the determination is completely not related or even related to the talent measure.
So far, the best idea I've heard about developing determination in children is something called growth mentality."
This is an idea developed at Stanford University by Carol Doctor, and it's the belief that the ability to learn is not fire, that it can change with the effort.
Dr. Doctor has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how they change and grow in response to challenge, they're much more likely to perceive when they fail, because they don't think that failure is a permanent condition.
So growth mindset is a great idea to develop detection.
But we need more.
And that's where my speech, because that's where we are.
That's the work we have ahead of it.
We need to take our best ideas, our strongest intuitions, and we need to test them.
We need to measure if they have been successful, and we need to be willing to fail, to get wrong, to start everything again.
In other words, we need to be determined about making our kids more determined.
Thank you.
Growing up in Taiwan like the daughter of a california, one of my most frightening memories is my mother showing the beauty, the shape and the shape of Chinese characters.
Since that moment, I was amazed by this incredible language.
But for a foreign, it seems to be as impressive as the Great Wall China.
In the last few years, I've been wondering if I can break this wall, so that I want to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language can do it.
I started thinking about how a new and quick method of learning Chinese could be useful.
Since I was five years old, I started learning how to draw each of the pieces of every character in the right sequence.
I learned new characters every day for the next 15 years.
Because we only have five minutes, it's better than we do it in a faster and simple way.
A Chinese academics would understand 20,000 characters.
You just need a thousand to understand basic literacy.
The first 200 will allow you to understand 40 percent of the basic literature, enough to read transit signals, members of restaurant, understanding the basic idea of the websites or the newspapers.
Today I'll start with eight to show you how the method works.
Are you ready?
They open their mouth as much as they can until it's square.
They get a mouth.
This is a person who's going to give a ride.
Personal.
If the shape of fire is a person with arms in both sides, as if I was screaming in a fresh way, "Audience: I'm burning it -- this symbol is actually original in the form of the call, but I like to believe it's the other way. The one that works.
This is a tree.
tree.
This is a mountain.
The sun.
The moon.
The symbol of the door looks like a couple of door doors in the old west.
I call these eight careers.
These are building blocks to create a lot more characters.
One person.
If someone walks back, that's "sure."
As the old said, two are company, three are multiple.
If one person is going to be their arms, this person is saying, "It was that big.
The person inside the mouth, the person is stuck.
It's a prisoner like Jones inside the whale.
A tree is a tree, two trees together, we have a forest.
Three trees together, we also have the forest.
Put a table under the tree, we have the food.
You put a mouth on the tree, that's a "design."  Easy to remember, because a particular tree is quite idiot.
Remember the fire.
Two fire together gets very hot.
Three fire together, that's a lot of call.
Put the fire under the two trees, that is to burn it.
For us, the sun is the source of prosperity.
Two suns together, prison.
Three together, those are details.
Put the sun and the moon shining together, that's the brilliant.
It also means tomorrow, after one day and a night.
The sun comes out on the horizon. Anami.
A door. Put a table inside the door, is the dream of the door.
You put a mouth inside the door, ask questions.
Touch, touch there?
This person is coming out of a door, sticking, evaporating.
On the left, we have a woman.
Two women together, they're discussing.
Three women together, keep care is adult.
So we've already gone through almost 30 characters.
By using this method, the first eight radio will allow you to build 32.
The next group of eight characters will build another 32.
So with every little effort, they'll be able to learn a couple hundreds of hundreds, which is the same thing as learning an eight year-old Chinese.
So after knowing the characters, we started creating sentences.
For example, the mountain and fire together, we have a fire mountain -- it's a volume.
We know that Japan is the land of the national sun.
This is a sun placed with the origin because Japan is east of China.
So a sun next to the origin we created Japan.
One person behind Japan, what do we have?
A Japanese person.
The character on the left are two mountains stacked one over the other.
In the ancient China, that meant in exile. Because Chinese entrepreneurs would represent their political enemies beyond mountains.
Today, the existence has become coming out.
A mouth that tells you to go out is a standard.
This is a slide to remind me that I should stop talking and down the stage. Thank you.
What I prefer to be a dad are the movies I come to see.
I love sharing my favorite films with my children, when my daughter was four years old, we saw the Ocean magic together.
The movie mastered his imagination for months.
His favorite character was Glenning, of course.
He gave him a good excuse to use a bright dress and take a magic vagina.
But when you see that movie so many times, you get to understand that it's extraordinary.
We now live and raise our children in a kind of industrial fantasy of child fantasy.
However, the May of Oz was an event in itself.
It didn't start that trend.
The trend really took a quarter of a quarter years later, curiously, another movie whose proteins, a metal boy and a furry kid rescued a girl dressed as a guard of the enemy.
Do you know what I'm talking about?  Yeah.
There's a big difference between these two films, there are a couple of great differences between the Olympic magician and all the movies that we see today.
One is that there is very little violence in the Ocean magic.
monkeys are pretty aggressive, like apples.
But I think that if the Ocean magician is done today, the magician would say, DoronCo, you are the savanna of Oz as the prophecy.
You use magic shoes to defeat the computer-generated army communities.
But that's not what happens.
Another unique thing in the Ocean magician is that the most heroic characters and wise and even violent are women.
I started noticing this when I made Star Wars to my daughter, a few years later, and the situation was different.
At that time, I also had a son.
Just three years.
It wasn't invited to the projection because it was still very small for that.
But it was the second son, and the level of surveillance had gone down.  And therefore he went down in the room and she was impressed as a mom leg with his pathogens behind me, and I don't think he would understand what he was happening, but inevitably, he was blown up everything.
I wonder what it is.
Would we be issues of value, perspective and real?
Would you have the sense that Luke joined an army to defeat the government?
Let's compare this with the Osland Margaret Marga.
How do you win Doroff your movie?
They do good mines with everybody and being a leadership.
It's the kind of world that I want my kids to grow up, and not a world of men who fight, which is where we are.
Why is there so much force for F. Force in the movies for our children, and so little about the way of yellow liberals?
There's a lot of literature about the impact of male violence in girls, and you should read it. It's very good.
I have not read so much about how children react to this study.
I know for experience that the Chinese princess doesn't provide the right framework that I would have served to navigate the world of adults which is mixing.  I think at the moment of the first kiss I really expected the credit to start to appear because it's the end of the film, right?
My search has finished, I have novel.
Why are they standing there?
I don't know what I should do.
The movies are focused on melting the violin and getting their reward, and they don't leave time for other relationships or other adventure.
It's almost like a child, you have to be a dumb animal, and if you're a girl, you have to use a war suit.
There are lots of exceptions, and defend the princess of Disney to any of you.
But they send a message to children, even though they, the kids, are not really their objective public.
They do a phenomenal job by teaching girls how to defend the pattern, but they don't necessarily show kids how to defend the pattern.
There's no model for them.
We also have some great women who write new stories for our children, as real and lovely like Himbaddy and Kates, but they don't stop being a war movie.
Of course, the most successful topic of all time continues to appear in classic after classic after classic, each of them on the adventures of a child or a man, or two men who are friends, or a man and his son, or two men who are creating a child.
Until many of you are thinking, this year, finally came out of value.
I recommend all of you. It's already available in stores.
Do you remember what the critic said when I came out Valley?
I can't believe that Pixar has made a movie of a print.
It's very good. Don't let them stop them."
Well, almost none of these movies happens the Beanis test.
I don't know if you've heard about this.
It hasn't been rooted yet. It's still spreading, but maybe today we will start a movement.
Alan Berlin is a comic carbon, and in the middle of the 1980s, I recorded a conversation that I had with a friend about the assessment of the movies that they saw.
And it's very simple. There are only three questions that have to do -- in the movie, is there more than a female character that has lines?
So you have to fulfill the requirement.
Are these women talk to each other at some point in the movie?
Their conversations are about something more besides the kid than so much?  All right? Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Two women who exist and talk about things each other.
It happens. I've seen it, and yet very rarely I see it in the movie we know and love.
In fact, this week, I went to see a very good quality film, Arm.
Right? So Scottish -- Spring success, an idea of a consensus of what a Hollywood movie is.
Virtually it doesn't happen the Beijing test.
And I don't think it should, because a lot of the film, I don't know if you've seen it, a lot of the movie happens in an ambassador where men and women hide during the reserves crisis.
We have a lot of scenes of men who have deep and painful conversations in this corner, and it's the great moment for one of the actions to take a look at the door and say, "You go to bed, career?
This is Hollywood.
So let's look at numbers.
In 2011, of the 100 more popular films, how many of them think they have female prototypes?
One. It's not bad.
It's not the same percentage as the number of women that we've chosen recently for Congress, then it's okay.
But there's a bigger number that is going to replicate this room.
Last year, The New York Times published a study that the government had done.
This is what he said.
In the United States, one in five women says it's been sexually assaulted in their life.
I don't think it's the fault of mass entertainment.
I don't think the movies for children have something to do with that.
I don't think that music or pornography videos are closely linked -- but something wrong, and when I hear that statistic -- one of the things I think is there is a lot of sexual farmers.
Who are those guys? What are they learning.
What don't you get to learn?
Are you taking the story that says that the role of a male hero is to defeat the villain with violence and then get the reward, which is a woman who doesn't have friends and doesn't talk about it?
Are we looking at that story?
You know, as a father with the privilege of raising a daughter like those of you who are doing the same, we find this world and this very alarming statistic and we want to prepare them.
We have tools to our willingness as to spin power, and we hope that that help, but I have to ask, but I have to ask, will you get power is going to protect them if at the same time, active or passively are we educating our children to keep their math power?
I mean, I think the Netflix list is a way to do something really important, and here I mean primarily the parents.
I think we have to show our children a new definition of men.
The definition of the masculinity is radically changing.
You'll have read about how new economy is changing the role of the home and the asteroid.
Everything is changing.
When I asked my daughter what his favorite character was from Star Wars know what he responded?
Welcomethic Okaironate.
Obama and Glenning.
What do they have in common these two?
Maybe it's not just the bright dress.
I think they're experts.
I think these are the two people in those movies that know more than anyone, and they love to share their knowledge with other people to help them reach their potential.
They're leaders.
I like that kind of stories for my daughter, and I like those kinds of stories for my son.
I want more stories like that.
I want fewer stories in which I say to my son, "Go and fight just and more stories where you see their job is to join a team, maybe a team led by women, to help other people better and be better people, like the May of Ocean.
Thank you.
As a child, I lived in Maine and one of the things that I liked most was looking for sea cookies on the shores of Maine because my parents told me that that would give me luck.
But you know, it's hard to find these screens.
They're covered with sand and it's hard to see them.
However, over time, I used to look for them.
I began to see shapes and patterns that helped me collect them.
This became a passion for finding things, in a love for the past and the architecture.
And finally when I started studying Egyptian, I realized to do with my own eyes wasn't enough.
Because, suddenly, in Egypt, my little beach in Maine had grown up to one of almost 2,000 miles of length along the Nile.
And my sea cookie had grown to the size of cities.
This is really what led me to use satellite images.
So to try to make a map of the past, I knew I had to do it differently.
I want to show you an example of how different we see when we use infrared using.
This is a place located in the eastern decline of Egypt called Benjamin.
And the place, to simple sight, seems to be brown -- but when we use infrared and process it using false color, suddenly the place looks like bright pink pink roof.
What you're looking at are the actual chemical changes of the landscape caused by the construction materials and the activities of ancient Egyptians and activities.
I want to share with you how we've used satellite data to find an ancient Egyptian city, called the Italian, lost for thousands of years.
Italian was the capital of ancient Egypt for over 400 years in a period of time called the Middle Empire about 4,000 years ago.
The place is located in El Fan, Egypt, and it's really important because in the Middle Empire, there was this great renaissance of ancient Egyptian art, architecture and religion.
The Egyptians have always known that "Atheisthale was located somewhere near the printers of the two kings that built them, indicated within the red circles here, but somewhere within this huge aluminum plan.
This area is enormous, it measures about six to four miles.
Before, the Nile flew right next to the United States side, and as it changed over time, it was brought into this and covered the whole city.
So how do you find a city set in a strange landscape?
And trying to find it to the random would be the equivalent of looking for a needle in a short, with the eyes sold and using baseball gloves using baseball gloves and using baseball gloves and using baseball gloves and using baseball gloves and using baseball gloves and using baseball gloves and using baseball gloves and using baseball gloves and using baseball gloves and using baseball gloves and using baseball
So we use NASA software data to make a map of the place, with very subtle changes.
We were able to see where the Nile was.
But you can see more slowly, and it's even more interesting, this slightly extended area that looks inside of the circle here, that we think it could be the location of Italian.
So we collaborated with Egyptian scientists doing sample jobs, you can see it here.
When I say showing you, it's like the show tasks in ice, but instead of climate change, we look for human occasion.
Five meters down, under a thick layer of noise, we found a dense layer of chemical objects.
This means that in this possible location of Ethiopia, five meters down, we have a case of occupation of several hundreds of years that fall from the Middle Empire, exactly the same period we think it's "Atheisthan.
We also found portrait jobs, coral, car and catch, which shows that there was a jewelry shop.
This might seem to seem like it's not a lot, but when we think about the most common stones used in the Middle Empire, these are the stones that were used.
So we have a dense layer of occupation that goes from the Middle Empire in this place.
We also have evidence of a elite jewelry workshop that shows that what's been there, was a very important city.
We still don't find it in Star here, but we will go back to place in a near future to locate it.
And even more importantly, we have the resources to capture young Egyptians in the use of satellite technology so that they can also perform big discoveries.
I want to end with my favorite quote from the Middle Empire, probably was written in "Atheisthale 4,000 years ago.
To share knowledge is the biggest of all the voices.
There's nothing like that on Earth.
So according to it, TED was not founded in 1984 D.
They made ideas really happen in 1984 to C. in a lost city not for a long time and found from the top.
It certainly puts the search of marine shells.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I want to invite you to close your eyes.
Imagine standing outside the door.
I want you to pay attention to the color of the door, to the material that's done.
Now visualizing a group of obese obesity in bicycle.
They're competing in a nuclear nuclear race and they're going to address their gate door.
I need you to see this really true.
They're standing strong, they're supporting, they're going a lot.
And they collide against the door of his house.
There are bicycles, flying all over the place, wheels that go back to their side, and the wheels that end up in absorbed places, and they pass the threshold of the door.
To the lobby, to the poster, or what there is the other side of the door, and look at the quality of light. The bright light on the Golden Montromo.
They're waving them with your hand.
From his chair on a brown horse.
It's a horse talking about.
You can feel your blue fight making you cancer in the nose.
You can smell the cow cookie and pass that it's about to get into the mouth.
They go on the side and train their living room.
In the room, and doing maximum use of his imagination, imagine British Speeks.
It's a little bit of clothes, dancing over his center of center, singing "Titan Be Baby Marter One."
Now give me the kitchen.
The soil has been coated with a walk of yellow brick and from the oven to you Doroffails, the Homo of Houston, the Spanish and the lion of "The Ocean of Ocean," came out of the hands, jumping to you.
Okay. Open your eyes.
I want to tell you about a peculiar contest that takes every spring in New York.
It's called the United States."
I went to cover this event a few years ago as a scientific journalist, waiting for, I guess, that this was like the end of a wise supermarket.
There were several men and a few ladies of different ages and different hygiene.
They were memorize hundreds of random numbers, looking at them just once.
They memorize the names of dozens and dozens of strangers.
They memorize entire poems in just minutes.
They compete to see who could memorize the order of a narrative barrel.
And I thought, "This is amazing.
These people must be phenomena of nature.
And I started talking to some of the competitors.
This is a man named Ed Couries who had come from England and he has one of the best formed memories.
I said, "Well, when did you realize you were a savanna?
Ed replied, "I am not a savanna.
Actually, I have an average memory.
Everybody who participated from this competition say they have normal memory.
"We have trained us to perform these miraculous acts of memory using ancient techniques -- they invented 2,000 years ago in Greece, the same techniques that Circle used to memorize their speeches and that medieval academics used to memorize whole books.
And my reaction was, "Wow, how did I have not heard of this before?
We were standing outside the room of competition, and Ed who is a wonderful and brilliant English, even though a little bit exception, he said, "John, you are an American journalist.
Do you meet Britney Spinosaurus?
And I said, "What? No, why?
Because I would like to teach Britney Simplers how to memorize the order in a live emphasis barrel, in national television.
That would test the world that anyone can do it."
And I said, "Well, I'm not British Springs, but maybe you can teach me.
I mean, you have to start by something not?
And that was the beginning of a very strange journey for me.
I ended up spending most of the next year not just by training my memory, but also research, trying to understand how it works, why sometimes it doesn't work, and what it can be their potential.
I met a lot of really interesting people.
This is a man called EC.
He is an immune, very probably with the worst memory in the world.
His memory was so bad that I didn't even remember that he had a memory problem. It's amazing.
Somebody incredibly tragic -- but it was a window that allows us to see how much our memory makes us who we are.
On the other end of the spectrum I met this man.
This is Kim Peter. He was based on Dutch Hollywood paper in the movie River Man."
We spent a afternoon together in the public library of Salt Lake City, memorizing phone books, was central.
And when I went back, I read a number of treaties about written memory about 2,000 years ago, in Latin, and then in the Middle Ages.
And I learned a lot of really interesting things.
One of the most interesting things I learned is that there was a time when this idea of having trained memory, discipline and culture was not a thing as rare as we can look at today.
A long time ago, people are investing in their memory, in providing their minds.
These techniques have made possible our modern world, but they've also changed us.
They have changed us culturally and I would say that they have changed us as well.
As we already have no need to remember, sometimes we seem to have forgotten how to do it.
One of the last places on our planet where people are still passionate for this idea of a trained memory, discipline and culture is this very unique competition of memory.
It's actually not so simple, there are competition like this around the world.
I was fascinated. I wanted to know how these people do.
A few years ago, a group of researchers from the College College of London invited a group of memory champions to the lab.
They wanted to know: Is it going to have brains in some way, structure or analyzing different from the rest of us?
The answer was, no.
Are they smarter than the rest of it?
They gave them a cognitive test battery, and the answer was actually not.
There was a really interesting and significant difference between the brains of memory champions and the control subjects that compare them.
When they put them in a magnetic resonance machine, they raised their brains as they memorize numbers and faces and surface compassions -- they found that in memory camps were lit parts of the brain, different people others.
They were actually using them, or they seemed to use, a part of the brain that involves space and navigation.
Why? Is there something we can learn from this?
The tournament of competitive memory is driven as an armed race where every year comes up with a new way to remember more things, faster, and then the rest of the competitors must be put a day.
This is my friend Ben Prize, three times a memory camp.
In his desk, in front of him, there are 36 narratives of narratives that he's about to try to memorize in an hour, using a technique that he invented and he just mastered it.
He used a similar technique to memorize the precise order of 4,400 black binary digits.
In half a hour. Yeah.
And while there's a lot of ways to remember things in these competitions, absolutely all the techniques used at the end of the end are reduced to one concept that psychologists call electromagnetic compassion."
It illustrates with an elegant paradigm known as the Babylon paradox. "White says, "I tell two people you remember the same word. I tell you that there's a man called Baby."
That's their approach.
And then I ask you, remember there's a baby ballot."
And when I go back later, and I ask you, "Do you remember that word that I told you a little bit?
Remember what it was?
The person who was told that his name is Baker is unlikely to remember the same word as the person he told him that his work is baby."
Same word, different access capacity. That's weird.
What happens here?
Well, the name Bay, it doesn't really mean anything for you.
With all the other memories that dance for their head.
But the word "bag") Baby."
They use white simple simple.
They have street in their hands.
They smell well when they go home to work.
We probably know some baker.
And when we first heard that word for the first time, we began to put active bonds in order to make them easily at some point.
One of the most elaborate techniques to do this data for 2,500 years ago in the ancient Greece.
It's known as the plate of memory."
The story says this: There was a poet called Similar to a band.
They had hired it as an entertainment because before, if you wanted to give a very good party, it didn't go to a DNA, it was hired to a poet.
He stood up his feet, he got his memory poem and she was married, and so soon he was the room of the boat collapses.
Taking them all together.
But not only killed them all, but it destroys the bodies by getting refugees.
No one could say who was there, nobody could remember where they were sitting.
So they couldn't understand the bodies.
One tragedy behind the other.
Similarity, standing outside, only survivor, in the middle of the rubble -- closed the eyes and realized that with the eyes of his mind, I could see where every invited had been.
I took the family family families taking them where their beings were loved between the scratches.
What Similar added at that moment is something that we all know more or less intuitively, and it is that no matter whether we are not good to remember names or phone numbers or words for the word of our colleagues, we have visual memory and exploitation space.
If you ask me to remember the first 10 words in history I just told you about Similaria, it's very likely to be able to do it very hard to do.
But I would bet that if you ask you to say who was sitting on the horse in your lobby, you would be able to visualize it.
The idea of the memory of memory is to create this building with the eyes of your mind and put it out of images with the things that you want to remember -- the more crazy the crazy, delayed, funny, scary and while it's the image, more unlikely to be.
This is a advice that comes from over 2,000 years ago, to the first treaties of memory, later.
And how does it work?
So let's say you've been invited to the TED stage to give a talk and you want to do it in memory, the same way that you would have done it if you had invited it to TEDx 2,000 years ago.
What you might do is imagine you're at the door of your house.
And I will figure out some kind of absolutely ridiculous, crazy image to help you remember that the first thing you want to mention is that completely insecure competition.
And then you can imagine entering your house, and you can see the Monterey Color mounted about Mister Ed.
And that would remind you that you want to introduce your friend Ed Corruption.
And then you would see Britney Sirsins to remind you that funny anecdote that you want to tell.
And then they would go into the kitchen, and the fourth issue they would talk about would be that strange journey that they did for a year, and they have some friends to help them remember it.
This is how the Roman partners memorize their speech, not word for word, which is going to confuse them but typical by typical.
In fact, the term typical comes from the Greek Greek, which means "Play."
It's a version of when people thought about the orphanage and the rhetoric with this kind of space terms.
The phrase in the first place, it would be like the first place in its memory plate.
I saw that this was just fascinating, and I got out of it.
I went to some of these memory competitions, and I had the idea of writing something weird about this supermarket member of memorialism.
But there was a problem.
The problem was that a memory competition is a potentially boring event.
Seriously, it's like seeing a lot of people sitting by taking tests. I mean, the most exciting thing that happens is when someone gets rid of the front.
I'm a journalist, and I need to be able to write about something.
I know there are amazing things happening in the minds of these people, but I don't have access to it.
I realized that if I was going to tell this story, I needed to try to put it in place.
So I began to spend 15 or 20 minutes every morning, before I sat to see the New York Times, just trying to remember something.
Maybe a poem. Or the names of an ancient school annual bought in a budget market.
And I discovered that this was surprisingly entertaining.
I would never have expected it to be.
It was entertaining because it wasn't just about training memory.
What is actually about doing is getting more and more the ability to create and imagine these ridiculous images, comics, protective, insects, angry and unable listener, in the eye of mind.
I'm pretty excited about this.
This is me, using my team standard for memory competition.
It's a pair of shoes and a few security glasses.
I ended up coming back to the same contest that I had covered a year before, and I had the idea that it could enter a kind of participatory period experiment.
I thought this could serve for all of my research.
The problem was that the experiment was out of control.
And I won the contest -- something that I didn't have to happen.
Of course it's nice to be able to memorize speech, and phone numbers, and shopping lists, but actually this is not the point.
These are just tricks.
Because they're based on pretty basic principles about how the brain works.
And you don't need to be able to build the memory blocks or memorize narratives of nations, and to benefit with a little bit of perspective about how your mind works.
We often talk about people with a great memory as if it was an innate gift but it's not the case.
Big memories are education.
At the most basic level, we remember when we pay attention.
We remember when we concentrate deeply.
The memory palace -- these memory techniques, are just shortcuts.
In fact, they're not even true.
They work because they make us work.
They force a kind of deep processing -- a kind of complete attention that most of us are not running around there.
But the reality is, there are no shortcuts.
This is how things do memories.
And if there's something that I want to leave you with today, it's what ECX, the animal that I couldn't even remember that I had a memory problem, I left to me, which is the notion that life is the sum of our memories.
How much are we willing to lose from what our short existence is in the Black or iPhone, not paying attention to the human being in front of us, who walks on our side, will be so monolithic that we don't even bother processing in deep?
I learned firsthand that there are incredible memory capabilities in all of us.
But if you want to live a memorable life, you must be the kind of person who remember remember.
Thank you.
Today I'm going to talk to you about the last 30 years of the history of architecture.
It's a lot to cover in 18 minutes.
It's a complex topic, so we'll take only a complex place, New Jersey.
Because 30 years ago, I am from No. Jerky, I was six years old and lived in my parents' house in a village called Linux, and this was my child bedroom.
In the corner, from my bedroom, I was the bathroom I shared with my sister.
And between my bedroom and the bathroom, there was a balcony.
And there they all pass the challenge by looking at the TV, so every time I went from my room to the bathroom, everybody saw me -- and every time I was shower and I wrapped into a towel -- everybody saw me.
And I was like this.
He was tarified, insecure and hated it.
I hated that race, hated that balance, hated that room and that house.
That's the architecture.
List.
Those feelings, those emotions that I felt, that's the power of architecture, because architecture is not about mathematics, not division division -- but of those visceral connections, emotional connections, that we feel in the places that we have.
And it's not surprising that we sit in that way, because according to the Environmental Protection Agency -- Americans spend 90 percent of their time under roof.
So, 90 percent of the time we're surrounded by architecture.
That's a lot.
Architecture determines us in ways that we don't even realize it.
That makes us a little naive and very, very predictable.
This means that when I show you a building like this, I know what it makes you, you think of power," "slap and democracy.
And I know they think about it so that they were based on a building about 2,500 years ago by the Greeks.
This is a trick.
It's a design that the architects use to create an emotional connection with the ways we build our buildings.
It's a predictable emotional connection, we've used this trick for a very, very long time.
We use it 200 years ago to build banks.
We use it in the 19th century to build art museums.
And in the 20th century in America, we use it to build houses.
Look, these stable, solar soldiers, in front of the sea, removed from the elements.
This is very, very useful, because building things is terrifying.
It's expensive, it takes a long time and it's very complicated.
The people who build the urban and the governments, always have fear of innovation, and they prefer to use ways they know they're going to work.
So we met buildings like this.
It's a nice building.
It's the Public Public Library of Linux who ended up in 2004, in my hometown, and, you know, it has a dome -- it has this round thing, columns -- the red brick -- that let Lincoln try to communicate with this building, the kids, the property values -- the story.
But it doesn't have much to do with a library of today.
That same year, in 2004, on the other side of the country, you end up with another library, which looks like this.
It's in Seattle.
This library shows how we use the media in the digital age.
It's a new kind of public equipment for the city, a place to get together, read and share.
So how is it possible that in the same year, in the same country, two buildings, both called libraries are so completely different?
And the answer is that architecture works at the beginning of the pyramid.
On one side there is innovation, the architects that constantly drive new technologies, new technologies, new solutions for today's forms of life.
We drive, we drive and drive so much that we get out of people.
All black, this is depressed, you think we feel very well, but we're dead inside because we don't have any other choice.
We have to go on the other side and reconnect with those approached symbols.
So we do it, and we're all happy, but we feel like travel, so we started to experience again, we make a dancing pandemic back over and over and over again. So we've done this in the last 300 years, and of course it is, in the last 30 years.
Well, 30 years ago, we went out of the '70s.
Architects were busy experimenting with the so-called Brugalistic."
It has to do with concrete.
That can be guess.
Small windows in demographics.
Something really hard.
So we came up to the 1980s, and we started incorporating those symbols.
We pushed the page back into the other direction.
We take those forms that we know that we like and we update them.
We added and we added cake and we use new materials.
They love it.
We don't give up.
We take Chicago arms, and we turn them into skyscrapers that can be medieval struggles made of glass.
The shapes were lost, they won in audacity and color.
The waves became columns.
The children grew up to the size of buildings.
A madness.
But it was the 1980s, that was great.
We all spend the challenge in commercial centers, we moved to the neighborhoods, and there, in suburbia we can create our own architectural fantasy.
Those fantasies could be the meditation, the French or the Italian.
Probably with a symphony of bread.
This is what happens with protection.
This is what happens with symbols.
They're easy, they're cheap, because instead of creating new spaces, we prescribe memories from other places.
I know very well, and all of you know, this is not the Tone.
This is Ohio.
architects feel frustrated, and we started making the peace of the page again in the other direction.
In the '80s and early '90s, we started experimenting with the so-called description.
We download historical symbols -- now we have new technical design techniques, and we find new composition, some forms that are crashing against other ways.
This is academic and embarrassing, and it's super impaction. One is totally excluded.
Normally, the dark slope again in opposite direction.
But then, something amazing happened.
In 1997, this building.
It's the Bionic Big Biologist, from Frank George.
This building changed fundamentally the relationship of the world with architecture.
Paul Golden said that Bilbao was one of those rare moments when critical, academics and public in general, they were completely according to a building.
The New York Times did this construction of miracles.
The tourism in Bilbao increased by 2.5 percent when they finished the building.
So suddenly, everybody wanted one of those buildings, Los Angeles, Seattle, Chicago, New York, Cleveland, Spring.
Everybody wanted one, and George was everywhere.
He was our first star architecture.
But how is it possible that these forms, wild and radical forms, how can you make it possible to become ubiquitous around the world?
And it happened, because the media was beaten around them, and we quickly learned that those shapes meant culture and tourism.
We've created an emotional reaction with these shapes.
The same thing did the major mayor of the world.
So they all believed that if they had these forms, they had culture and tourism and tourism.
This phenomenon of beginning of the new millennium, with other stars star.
It happened to Zamble and Liberian, and what happened with these few elite architects in the threshold of the new millennium, actually started going on with all the architecture, digital media started to increase the speed of information consumption.
Think about, for example, how do you consume architecture.
A thousand years ago, they would have to have walked up to the next village to see a building.
Transparency is accelerated, you can take a ship, an airplane, you can be tourists.
Activist technology. You can see in the newspapers, on the TV, and at the end, we're all photographers of architecture, and the building is transported beyond its physical location.
Architecture is everywhere. That means the speed of communications finally has reached the speed of architecture.
Because architecture moves so fast.
It doesn't get a lot of time to think about a building.
You need a lot of time to build a building, three or four years, and at that time, an architect can design two, eight, or 100 more buildings more, before you know what I designed four years ago was a success or not.
Because there's never been good feedback in architecture.
That's how we find buildings like this.
But brutal was not a two-year-old movement but 20 years.
For 20 years, we were building buildings like this because we had no idea how much they were stopped.
That's never going to happen. I think, because we are in the threshold of the biggest revolution in architecture from the invention of the anternon, the steel or the elevator of the access, and it's the media revolution.
My theory is that when you apply the food to the media, it starts to make a bit faster and faster, until it will be in both extremes almost in simulation, and it gets rid of the difference between innovation and symbol, between us, the architects, and you, the public.
Now we can do almost instant symbols -- emotional charge of something completely new.
I'm going to show you how the system works in a project that my company ended up recently.
We were hired to replace this building.
This is the center of a village called Pinkers in Fire Island, in New York.
It's a vacation.
But that meant two years before the building, it was already part of the community, and as the drawings looked exactly the end of the product, there was no surprise.
The building came to be part of the community. That first summer, when people started coming and shared it in social media, the building stopped being a building, because these are not just images of a building, they're the images that you made from the building.
And as you use it to tell your story, you become part of personal narrative, and that makes you correlate with collective memory, and when you charge these symbols.
I mean, we don't need the Greeks to tell us how to think of architecture.
We can tell us mutually what we think of architecture, because digital media has not only changed the relationship between us, but they've changed the relationship between us and buildings.
Think for a second in those libraries of Linux.
If that building is going to be built today, first we went to the Internet in search of new libraries.
We would be bombarded with examples of experience, innovation of innovation, about what a library can be.
That's multiple.
Multinational munings can lead to the mayor of Linux, people in Linux, and tell them that there's no unique response to what a library is today.
We're part of this.
This abundance of solutions gives the freedom of experiencing it.
Everything is different now.
architects are no longer those mysterious creatures that use graduate words and complicated drawings, and one is not a desert public that doesn't accept something that I haven't seen before.
architects can listen, and you don't let it be interrupted by architecture.
That means that the dark slope of one style to another, from one movement to another, is irrelevant.
In fact, we can go ahead and find proper solutions to the problems facing society.
This is the end of the history of architecture, and it means that the tomorrow buildings will be very different from today's buildings.
This means that a public space in the ancient city of Sergevine can be unique and adapted to the measure of a modern city.
This means that a stadium in Brooklyn can be that, a stadium in Brooklyn, and not a bad historical imitation of red brick based on ideas of what has to be a stadium.
This means that some robots can build our buildings, because we will finally be ready for ways that are going to produce.
That means that buildings are tied to nature of nature and not the opposite.
This means that a parking garage in Miami Beach, Florida, can also serve to make sports or for yoga or even one can marry me at night.
This means that three architects can dream with swimming at the New York City in New York City, and it will raise half a million dollars from the community around that cause, it's not just a client alone.
It means that no building is too small for innovation, like this little gang of income, as much as the animals and the animals that are going to look at.
Because it doesn't matter whether it's a cow or a robot who builds our buildings.
It doesn't matter how we build, what matters is what we build.
architects already know how to make more ecological buildings, smarter and more kind.
We've been waiting for all of you to want them.
Finally, we're not in opposite side.
Find an architect and put them together and work together to make better buildings, better cities, for a better world, because there's a lot in play.
Buildings don't just reflect our society, but they give it way to the smallest spaces, the local libraries -- the homes where we form our children, and the step of the bedroom.
Thank you very much.
This is my niece, Stage.
He just turned a year and she already started walking.
And it makes it great, typical of the children of a year, disappointing, as if their body was moving too fast for their legs.
It's totally beautiful.
And one of the things that I like to do for the moment is to look at the mirror.
She really loves his reflex.
It goes down and child, and it gives themselves those big and humble kisses themselves.
It's beautiful.
So apparently, all of your friends do this and my mom tells me that I used to do it. And it made me think, when I stopped doing this?
How do we suddenly don't like our appearance with our appearance.
Because apparently we don't like it.
Every month, 10,000 people search at Google, "Am I crazy?
This is Faho, it's 13 years old and lives in Dennisha.
And as any teenager just wants to be loved and fit in.
It's Sunday at night.
It's preparing for next week in school.
It's a bit of fear, it's a little bit confused because, even though his mom tells him all the challenge she's beautiful, every day in school, someone tells him it's ugly.
And between what his mom tells him and what his friends or his friends in school say, he doesn't know who to believe.
So a video of herself makes it in YouTube, and I ask others to please leave a comment, "Am I nice or I'm wrong?
Well, so far, favor has received more than 13,000 comment.
Some of these are so unpleasant that it doesn't even deserve thinking about them.
We talk about a healthy teenager, normal and rural, who receives these answers in one of the most vulnerable life stages of their most vulnerable life.
Thousands of people are publishing videos like this, mostly teenage girls trying to communicate this way.
But what's taking them to do this?
Well, today's teenagers are almost never alone.
They're under pressure of being online and available all the time, talking, catching, giving me like like, eat, sharing, publishing -- this is never over.
We've never been so connected before, in a continuous way, in a very young way.
As a mother said to me, "It's like there's a party in your room every night.
There's simply no privacy.
And the social pressures you go from your hand with that are influenced.
This environment, of being always connected, is adding our children to be based on the number of "I like and the kinds of comments they get.
There's no divide between a online life and the real life.
It's really hard to know the differences between what's real or what it isn't.
And also, it's very hard to know the difference between what's authentic and what is digitally manipulated by it.
What is the most highlighted thing in someone else's life in front of what is normal in a daily context?
And where are you looking for inspiring?
Well, you can see the kind of images that are pointed from the news of girls now.
Zero models continue to dominate our players.
The technical scarce technique is now a rut.
And trends like, "Symphain, Shadiania, biomass and surface.
For those of you who know it, it means a prototype.
These trends are associated from women in popular culture today.
It's not hard to see what young people do.
But kids aren't immune to this.
Like the Supreme stars of sports, and the administrators single sands.
But what's the problem with all this?
Well, we certainly want our kids to grow healthy and be wonderful individuals.
But in a culture obsessed by the image, we're teaching our children to spend more time and mental effort to their appearance, to the price of all the other aspects of their identity.
Things like their relationships, the development of their physical capabilities -- their studies and other aspects start to suffer.
Six of every 10 girls prefer not to do something because they think they don't see the good enough.
These are not trivial activities.
They are fundamental activities for their growth as human beings and as controlled to society and the field of labor development.
31 percent, almost one in three teenagers are not interested in class. They avoid participating in classrooms because they don't want to call attention for their physical aspect.
One in five are not being attending classes at all, during the days when they don't feel comfortable about it.
And in the test season, if you don't think you look at the good enough, especially if you don't think you're happy enough, you'll get a note less than the average of your fellow who don't care about that about appearance.
And this phenomenon has been generated in Finland, United States and China.
And it's independent from what they actually weigh these young people.
So, so that we are very clear, we are talking about how you see you, not how you really are.
The low self-esteem over its body is delivering academic performance.
And it's also detrimental health.
The teenagers with little self-esteem do less physical activity, eat less fruits and vegetables, participate in more no healthy diet than they can bring them to food destroyed.
They have low self-esteem.
They are more easily influenced by the people who surround them and they're in higher risk of depression.
And we think it's all of this for what they make more risky decisions, like the consumption of alcohol and drugs, dramatic diet, aesthetic surgery, sexual relationships to early ages and without protection and self-assembly damage.
The pursuit of the perfect body is presenting the health system, and our government costs billions of dollars every year.
And we're not controlling it.
Women who believe that they have overweight again, irrespective of whether they have or don't have greater absence rate.
17 percent of women don't present to a job interview in one day where they don't feel safe with the way they look like.
Think for a moment in what this is doing to our economy.
If we could overcome this, what would that opportunity?
Liberating this potential is interest for each of us.
But how do we do that?
Well, talking, by itself, it doesn't take you very far.
Not enough.
If you really want to change things, you have to do something.
And we've learned that there are three key shapes, the first is that we have to instill trust in its own body.
We have to help our teenagers develop strategies to overcome the pressure of perfect images and build their self-esteem.
The good news is that there are many programs available to do it.
The bad news is that most of these don't work.
I was very surprised when I learned that a lot of very well-intentioned programs, without realizing the situation.
So we need to make sure that the program that our children follow not only will have a positive impact, but also a lasting impact.
And research studies show that the best programs focus on six key areas. The first is the influence of family, friends and relationships.
These six aspects are crucial points for any willing to provide an education in body self-esteem that works.
An education is fundamental -- but facing this problem requires each of us to take the rains in the issue and be a better model to follow women and girls in our own lives.
The current status of how women are seen and mentioned in our circles.
It's not good to tell us with the contribution of our politicians on hair cuts or the size of their chest, or to insist that the determination or the success of a Olympic athlete depends on the fact that it's not a great beauty.
We need to start judge people for what they are, not because they look like.
All of us can start making it by making responsibility by the kind of images and comments that we publish in our social networks.
We can praise people based on their effort and their actions and not in their appearance.
And let me ask you question: When was the last time you showed a mirror?
In short, we have to work together as communities, like governments and as companies, to change our culture, so that our children grow up valuing all their people, valuing the individuality, the diversity, the inclusion.
We have to put people who are really making the difference in a peniscient.
To make a difference in the real world, let's make them the ones that come out in the big screen because we just create a different world.
A world where our children are free to become the best version of themselves, where the way they think they are never going to be able to be who they are, or reach what they want in their lives.
Think about what this can mean for someone in their lives.
Who have you in mind?
Is their wife there?
Is your sister there?
Is his daughter.
Is it survive? Is it his friend?
It could just be the woman who is two seats of distance -- what would it mean for her if it was liberated from that authoritarian voice in his interior, that he was afraid of not having long legs -- moving them down, a more flat, feet smaller.
What would it mean for her if we were going to do this and we would say released to his potential that way?
Right now, the obsession of our culture with images is giving us all together.
But let's teach our kids the truth.
Let's show you that the way you see is just a part of your identity, and that the truth is that we love them for those who are and what they do, and as they make us feel.
We include the self-esteem in our schools.
We change each of us, the way we talk about and compare to other people.
And we work together as a community, from small groups to governments, so that the little bits of an age of today, they become safe agents of themselves tomorrow.
Let's do it.
On November five, 1990, a gentleman named Albar Monterey entered a hotel in Manhattan and killed the rabbi Merket Kaid, the leader of the Jewish Department.
Now, New Andrew initially declared it, but being prisoners for other charges, in company of others, they started planning attacks at about 12 New York City, including tunnels and silence and the United Nations.
Fortunately, those plans.
Sadly, the 1997 bomb in the World Trade Center couldn't be avoided.
And "Andrew would be convicted of its participation in that bombing.
Alice Monthbox is my father.
I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1983, being a Egyptian engineer, with a loving American mother, primary school teacher.
Only when I was seven years old, our family started to change.
My father taught me a form of Islam, which very few, even most Muslims -- come to know.
For experience I saw that when people take time to interact, it doesn't require a lot to get the same things in life.
However, in every religion, in all human groups, there is always a small fraction of people who are so deeply clinging to their convictions that think we need to use all the possible media for everybody to live like them.
A few months before the arrest he sat up with me and explained that in the last few weeks, he and some friends had been going to land training in Long Island, to practice.
He told me that I would go with him the next day.
We came to the Carling Pigor police, which without knowing our group, was raped by the FBI.
When I got to throw up, my father helped me sustain the rich man in the shoulder, and it explained to me how to aim the goal at about 30 feet.
That day, with the last bullet that I shot I gave the little orange light on the goal, and for surprise of all, especially me, all the goal in flames.
My uncle went back to the other and Arabic, said "Wow absorbing."
Of such a parent, such a son.
All of them, the comment produced a lot of laughter. But just a few years later, I understood what they were so funny.
They saw in me, the same level of destruction that my father could cause.
Those people later would be convicted of putting one out of them with 700 pounds of explosives in the underground parking of the World Trade Center, causing an explosion that killed six people and hurting another 1,000.
I admired those men.
I called them a "mammot: meaning you.
When I was 19, I had moved for 20 times. That instability during my childhood didn't allow me to do a lot of friends.
Every time I started feeling comfortable close to someone who was now time to engage and go to another city.
As it was always me the new face of the class often was material victims.
I became secret my identity to avoid being the white, but it will be the new of the class, silence and red, it was enough multiple.
So most of the time I spent it at home reading books, watching TV or playing video games.
For these reasons I didn't develop social skills, to say it gently -- to grow under funding, I wasn't prepared for the real world.
I was educated to judge people, based on arbitrary indicators like their race or their religion.
So how could I open the eyes?
One of the first experiences that put up my way to think, was during presidential elections of 2000.
In a previous program that I participated in the Japanese National Convention, in Philadelphia.
My group was focused on the subject of youth violence, as I had been a material victim almost all my life, was something that I felt a lot of passion.
The members of this group came from different events.
One day, at the end of the convention, I discovered that one of the kids who had made a friendship -- was Jewish age.
It took several days to go out of light this detail and realized that there was no antibiotic in the two.
I had never had a Jewish friend of mine, and I was frankly feeling very proud to have been able to sell the barrier that all life had been made me believe that it was inflated.
Another crucial moment came when I got a summer job in Bush Gardens, a amusement park.
I found people from all kinds of beliefs and cultures, and that experience was fundamental in developing my character.
The whole life was taught me that the homosexual was a sin and, by extension, all the homes were bad influence.
For instance, I had the opportunity to work with gay actors there, in a show, and I could see that several of them were the most amazing and less critical I'd seen in life.
Having been a child, I developed a sense of empathy towards the suffering of others, but it wasn't easy for me to treat kind, exactly the way I would have wanted to be treated.
So I was able to hire the stereotypes that had taught me about a child, with the experience of interaction in real life.
I don't know how that being a homeless, but I know what it is to be judged by something beyond my control.
Then he came the "David Show."
Every night, Jon Stewart made me intellectually honest about my intelligence, and he helped me see that the race of people, religion or sexual orientation, have nothing to do with character.
In many ways, he became my Facebook figure in a moment when I was desperately doing it.
In occasion, inspiration can come from inspired, and that a Jewish comedian had had a better influence in my life than my own father, extreme, was not in reverse.
One day I had a conversation with my mother about how I was changing my thinking about thinking, and she told me something that I would preserve in my heart forever, while it's alive.
She looked at me with the eyes tired of someone who has suffered enough with intelligent dominance, and he said, "I'm tired of hate."
At that time, I realized how much negative energy is needed to keep all that hatred inside your inside.
My real name is not Zamble Egyptian.
I changed it when my family decided to break the relationship with my father and start a new life.
So why did I decide to go out and put myself in a responsible risk?
Well, it's simple.
I've done it because I hope somebody else, some day, who is trying to take the violence, can hear my story and understand that there is a better path. That even though I was told to this violent and useless ideology I didn't get to make me fantastic.
Instead, I decided to use my experience to fight terrorism and pressure against prescriptions.
I do it by the victims of terrorism and their loved ones, and by the terrible pain and loss that terrorism has produced them in their lives.
For the victims of terrorism talking, against those meaningless acts, as a refugee to my father's actions.
With this simple I'm showing you here as a proof that violence is not inherent to any religion or race -- that the children don't have to follow the paths of their parents.
I'm not my father.
Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.
At this moment, there's a movie that is projected in your mind.
It's an incredible multi-lineage film.
It's 3D, and it has Southern sound of what you hear and you see right now. But that's just the beginning.
Your film has a crammer, taste and texture.
You feel your body, your pain, your hungry, your pleasure.
It has emotions, anger and happiness.
It has memories, as moments of your childhood that are projected before your eyes.
And it's constantly a voice superimposed in your conscious thinking.
The heart of the movie is you who experience everything in directly.
This film is your flow of consciousness, the subject of the experience of mind and the world.
Consciousness is one of the fundamental truths of the existence of being human.
Each of us is conscious.
We all have an internal movie, you and you and you.
There's nothing we know more directly.
At least, I know that I have a consciousness.
I have no certainty that you are conscious.
Consciousness is also the reason to live.
If we were not aware of it, nothing in our lives would make sense or value.
But at the same time it's the most mysterious phenomenon in the universe.
Why are we conscious?
Why do we have these internal films, right?
Why are we not just robots that we need to produce outcomes without experiencing the internal movie experience?
At this point, nobody knows the answers to those questions.
I suggest that to integrate consciousness to science, you need some radical ideas.
Some people say it's impossible a science of consciousness.
The science, by nature, is target.
Consciousness, by nature, is subjective.
So there can never be a science of consciousness.
Because for almost the entire century, I predicted that vision.
psychology studied the behavior, the neuroscience was studying the brain, but no one mentioned the consciousness.
Even 30 years ago, when TED started, there were very few scientific jobs about consciousness.
Then, 20 years ago, everything started to change.
Neuroscientists like Francis Crick and physicists like Roger Press said, "Now it's time for science to open the consciousness."
And since then, there was a real explosion of the scientific work about consciousness.
And this work was fantastic. It was great.
But it also has fundamental limitations until the moment.
The center of science of consciousness in recent years was the pursuit of correlations between some areas of the brain and some states of consciousness.
We saw some of this guy in the fantastic work that Nancy Kansas presented a few minutes ago.
Now we understand much better, for example, the areas of the brain that are related to the conscious experience of seeing faces, or feeling pain or feeling happy.
But this is still a science of corals.
It's not an explanation science.
We know that these areas of the brain are related to certain kinds of conscious experiences, but we don't know why.
I'd like to explain that this kind of neuroscience of neuroscience answers some questions that we want it to explain consciousness -- questions about what they make certain areas of the brain and what they correlate with.
But in a sense, those are the easy problems.
No offense to neuroscience.
Actually, there are no easy problems with consciousness.
Because I don't take the real central mystery of this material, why is all physical processes in the brain have to be accompanied by consciousness.
Why is there a subjective movie film?
Right now, we can't understand it.
And you can say, let's take a few years to neuroscience.
It's going to become another emerging phenomenon like the demographics, like the hornings, like life, and we're going to find explanation.
The typical surgery is all cases of emerging behaviors, how the demographics operate -- how hurricane strains, how they reproduce them, they adapt and metabolize living organisms -- they're all questions about objective function.
That could be applied to the human brain to explain some behaviors and the functions of the human brain as an emerging phenomenon, how we walk, how we talk, how we play chess -- they're all questions about behavior.
But when it comes to consciousness, the questions about behavior are among easy problems.
But the hard problem, is the question of why all behavior is accompanied from a subjective experience?
And here it is, the standard paradigm of the emergence -- the standard paradigm of neuroscience, doesn't actually have much to say.
I'm a heart scientific material.
I want a scientific theory of the freeway that works. For a long time, I hit my head against the wall looking for a theory of consciousness in pure physical terms that would work.
But at the end, I got to the conclusion that it didn't work for systematic reasons.
I think we sit at this point.
We have a chain of wonderful explanations, great. We used to this -- physics explains chemistry, chemistry explains biology, biology explains part of psychology.
But consciousness doesn't seem to fit in this scheme.
On the one hand, it's a fact that we are conscious.
For another, we don't know how to accommodate that idea to our scientific vision of the world.
I think the consciousness, right now, is sort of a simulation, something that we need to integrate to our view of the world, but we don't know yet.
With an anomaly like this, you can need radical ideas, I think we need ideas that at the beginning to look crazy, before we can deal with consciousness in a scientific way.
There are some possibilities for those crazy ideas.
My friend Dan Dennett, who's here today, has one.
Their crazy idea is that there is no such hard problem of consciousness.
All the idea of the internal subjective movie includes a kind of illusion or confusion.
Actually, what you need to do, is to explain the objective functions, the brain behaviors -- and so you study everything you need explanation.
Well, more power for him.
That's the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if we want to have a theory of pure reductionistics, based on the brain.
At the same time, for me and for many others, that vision is pretty close to simply denying that the observation of consciousness is satisfying.
But I go in a different direction.
In the time that it is, I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think can be promised.
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is critical.
The physicists sometimes take some aspects of the universe as fundamental liberals: space, time and mass.
They put fundamental laws that govern them, like the laws of gravity or quantum mechanics.
These fundamental laws and properties are not explained in terms of anything else.
Rather, they're considered fundamental and the world is constructed.
Sometimes, the list of the fundamental is all off.
In the 19th century, Mahamusand discovered that you can't explain the electromagnetic phenomena in terms of fundamental concepts of presidential concepts, space, time, mass of Newton -- so I put the basic laws of electromagnetic, and put the electric charge as a fundamental concept that those laws govern in.
I think that's the situation that we find with consciousness.
If you can't explain consciousness in terms of fundamental ideas, space, time, mass, burden -- then for logic of logic -- you have to take the list out.
The most natural thing would be possible as a fundamental thing, a fundamental brick of nature.
This doesn't mean that it suddenly doesn't be the object of science.
It opens up the way to manage it scientifically.
So what we need is to study the fundamental laws that govern consciousness, the laws that connect consciousness with other fundamental concepts -- space space, time, mass processes.
The physicists sometimes say that we want fundamental laws so simple that we can scan them in a team.
The situation of consciousness is something like this.
We want to find fundamental laws so simple that we can scan them on a t-shirt.
We still don't know what laws are, but that's what we need.
The second crazy idea is that consciousness can be universal.
Every system can have a degree of consciousness.
This vision sometimes is called philosophers: "Panel for everyone, presentation for mind, every system is conscious -- not only humans, dogs, mice, flies, even Rob Kingdom, the elementary particles.
Even a picture has some degree of consciousness.
The idea is not that pictures are smart or they think.
It's not that a picture can be full of distress when he thinks, "Oh, always traveling to the speed of light.
I can never slow and smell the robots."
No, so no.
But the thinking is that maybe the photons can have some kind of raw feeling element, subjective sense, some primitive precursor of consciousness.
This can sound a little crazy for you.
How do anybody think something so crazy?
In part this comes from the first crazy idea, that consciousness is a fundamental thing.
If it's fundamental like space, time and mass, it's natural to assume that it can also be universal, just like others.
It's also worth noticing that even though the idea seems to us, it's much less for the people of different cultures, where the human mind seems more a continuum with nature.
A deeper reason comes from the idea that perhaps the simplest and powerful form of finding fundamental laws that relate thinking with the physical process, is to link awareness with information.
Whenever there's information processing, there's consciousness.
complex information, like in a human being, complex awareness.
Simple information, simple awareness.
Something really exciting is that in recent years a neuroscientist, Gilby Tony, took this kind of theory and developed it with mathematical methods.
It has a mathematical measure of information integration, which is called the Paul, which measures the degree of integrated information in a system.
And I guess it has to do with consciousness.
So in a human brain, there's an incredible degree of information integration -- a high degree of bad, a lot of consciousness.
In a mouse there is an average degree of information integration -- equally significant, degree of pretty important awareness.
But when you get to the worms of them, microbes -- particles -- the gift of my said saying.
The level of information integration is less, but it's not zero either.
In Tony theory, there will still be a level of different awareness of zero.
It actually provides a fundamental law of consciousness, high degrees of conference, high degrees of consciousness.
In addition, another reason is that the bankers can help us integrate awareness to the physical world.
physicists and philosophers often have observed that physics is curiously abstract.
It describes the structure of reality using a lot of equations, but it doesn't talk to us about the reality that underlies underneath.
As Stephen Hawking explains Steven, where does the fire of the equations?
From the physical vision, the equations of physics can be left as they are, but they can use to describe the flow of consciousness.
That's what physicists do basically describe the flow of consciousness.
According to this vision, consciousness is the one that puts it into the equations.
In that vision, consciousness is not found out of the physical world as a kind of addiction.
It's right there in the center.
This vision, I think, painful vision, has the potential to transfer our relationship with nature, and it can have a pretty serious social consequence.
Some may be all an allege.
I used to think that I shouldn't eat anything that had consciousness, then it should be vegetable.
If you're a painful and you accept that vision, you will have a lot of hungry.
I think thinking about it, this tends to transform your vision, whereas what matters in ethical terms and moral consequences, is not so much the fact of consciousness, but its importance and complexity.
It's also natural to ask for consciousness in other systems, like computers.
What about the San artificial intelligence system in the movie "One?
Is it conscious?
According to the vision of pioneering information, she has a complicated information processing and integrated information so that the answer is yes, if it's conscious.
If this is right, you get pretty serious ethical problems about the ethics of intelligent computers of intelligent computers and the ethics of them.
Finally, you can ask for full collective consciousness, the planet.
Did Canada have its own conscious?
Or at a more local level, an integrated group -- like the audience in a TED Talk, right now, we have a TED collective consciousness, an internal movie for this whole group of TED, different of the internal films of each of the parts.
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think at least it's a question that should be taken seriously.
So this pioneering vision is a radical view, and I don't know if it's right.
I'm actually more sure of the first crazy idea, that consciousness is a fundamental thing, that the second one is universal.
The vision raises a lot of questions, many challenges, like, how do those bits of thinking contribute to the kind of complex consciousness we know and love.
If we can answer those questions, then I think we go on the right way to a theory of serious consciousness.
If not, well, probably this is the hardest problem of science and philosophy.
We can't wait to solve it overnight.
But I think we're finally going to go to it.
Understanding consciousness is the real key, I think, to understand the universe and to understand ourselves.
Maybe we just need the right crazy idea.
Thank you.
I grew up in a small rural village in Victoria.
He had a very normal profile, a low education profile.
I went to school, I got together with my friends, I was happy with my younger sisters.
Everything was very normal.
And when I was 15, a member of my community came up to my parents because I wanted to name for a community prize.
And my parents said, "Well, that's very nice, but there's an obvious problem.
She doesn't really get anything."  And they were right.
I went to school, I had good grades. After school, I had a low profile in my mother's police, and I spent a lot of time looking at the "Bosoto Saul Vandelium and Darwinian Creative."
Yeah, I know. What contradiction.
But they were right.
I didn't do anything that was extraordinary at all.
Nothing that can be considered as a achievement if we take the disability outside of the equation.
Years later, being in the second part of the teaching in a high school of Melocry, just after about 20 minutes in the 11th class of surgeon studies a girl lifted up the hand and said, "Hey, when you give you your speech?
And I said, "What do I do?"
Well, I had been talking to you about the law of data for some good 20 minutes.
And he said, "You know, your motivation speech.
When people in wheelchair, they talk about inspiring things in school?
"They're usually in the act of actions."
And it was then when I realized, this kid had had experiences with people with disability as an inspiration.
And we don't. And it's not culture of the guy, it is, that's true for many of us.
For us, people with disability are not our teachers or our doctors or our manipulations.
We're not real people. We're there to inspire it.
And in fact, I'm on this stage looking at what I do in this wheelchair, and you're probably waiting for them to inspire them. Right?  Yes.
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid I'm going to be able to disappoint them.
I'm not here to inspire them.
I'm here to tell you that they have lied us in relation to disability.
Yes, they have sold us the lie that disability is something bad, to mass, I match.
It's something bad and living with a disability makes you exceptional to you.
It's not a bad thing, and it doesn't make it great.
And in the last few years, we've been able to spread even more this lie through social media.
You may have seen images like this, "The only disability in life is a bad attitude.
Or this one: "Your excuse is investigated."
Or this one: Before I left, interference."
These are just a couple of examples, but there's a lot of them.
You may have seen one, of the girl without hands drawing with a pencil held by the mouth.
You may have seen a child who runs with cardiac legs of carbon fiber.
And there's a lot of these images, which are what we call porn inspiration.
And I use the term definitely, because they match a group of people for the benefit of another group of people.
So in this case, we are looking at the disabled disconnected of people without disability.
The purpose of these images is to inspire them, motivate them, so we can see them and think, "Well, for very bad to be my life, it could be worse.
I could be that person.
But what if you're that person?
I've lost the story of the number of times that I've been extremely strange to want to express that you think I'm brave or an inspiration source, and this happens before my work had a public profile.
It was like I would congratulate me in the morning and remember my own name.  And this is constitution.
These images, those images match people with disability in the benefit of people without disability.
They're there so you can see them and think that things aren't so bad for you, or to put their concerns in perspective.
And life as a disabled person is actually something difficult.
We got some things.
But the things that we overcome are not the things that you can think.
They're not relative to our bodies.
I use the term discourage discouraged, deliberately because I subscribe to the so-called social model of disability that tells us that we are more disabled because of the society that we live than because of our bodies or diagnosis.
So I've lived in this body for a long time.
I'm very happy with him.
It does the things that I need to do, and I've learned to take the best of your ability as well as you do, and that's what happens with the children of those pictures as well.
They're not doing anything out of the common.
They are just using their bodies taking the best of their ability.
So is it really fair to match them in the way we do it, by sharing those images.
When people say, "You're a source of inspiration -- it tells you as a complete.
And I know why it happens.
It's because of the lie, because they have sold us this lie that disability makes us exceptional to us.
And honestly, it doesn't do it.
And I know what you're thinking.
I'm here by stealing the inspiration and you think, "Why are you not sometimes inspired by something?
And actually, I know I am.
Learning from other people with disability at all.
However, I don't learn that I'm more lucky than them.
Let me learn that this is a great idea to use a little bit of barbaria to collect the things that are falling down.  I learn the ingenious trick of how to charge the mobile phone battery on the chair battery.
Great.
We learn from the strength and resilience of others, not our bodies and our diagnosis, but against a world that explains and costs us.
I really believe that that lie.
It makes us hard life.
And that quote, "The only disability in life is a bad attitude, the reason that that's lie is because it's not true, because of the social model of disability.
A lot of smiles to a stage of stairs has never done that it becomes a radio.
Never --   Senior to a television screen will not make the subjects appear for deaf people.
Not a lot of people in the middle of a bookstore and radiationing a positive attitude to convert all those books into the bank.
It's simply not going to happen.
I want to really live in a world where disability is not the exception, but the norm.
I want to live where a 15 year-old girl sitting in his bedroom watching "Book the Same Sandwattan "does not worry about anything about being in a chair.
I want to live in a world where we don't have so low expectations of people with disability that we are happy to get away from bed and remember our names in the morning.
I want to live in a world where we value the genetic achievement of people with disability, and I want to live in a world where a boy of 11 degrees in a high school in Melocry is not a little surprising that its new teacher is a wheelchair user.
Disability doesn't make us exceptions, but question what you think you can know about what you do.
Thank you.
What do you have to look at augmented reality and professional football, with empathy empathy?
And what is the average speed of a giant grandmather?
Unfortunately, today just answering one of those questions, so please don't get away.
When people think about augmented reality, it thinks in "Minima Republic: and in Tom Cross hiding hands in the air, but the augmented reality is not science fiction.
And the augmented reality is something that will happen in our days and will happen because we have the tools for it, and people need to know it, because the augmented reality will change our lives as much as the Internet and mobile phones.
So how do we get to augmented reality?
The first step is what I'm wearing is: Google Glass.
I'm sure many are familiar with them.
What you may not know is that Google Glass is a device that allows them to see what I see.
I'll allow you to experience what is a professional sport in the field.
Right now, the only way to be in the field is that I try to describe them.
I have to use words.
I have to create a framework that you will fill with your imagination.
We can use the Google Glass, under a helmet and know what is running through the game field at 100 miles -- blood hitting the ears.
We can know that you feel that a 100 pounds of man would chase us, trying to get rid of all of its being.
I've been there and I'm sure it's not nice.
I bring some videos to show you what the Google Glass, under the helmet and give you an idea of that.
Unfortunately, they're not images of NSA practices, because the idea of the Embassy of emergent technology is a submarine coming up to the surface -- but we do what we can.
So let's see a video.
Chris Kelly: Come on.
It's horrible to be taken.
A moment. Let's zoom a little bit.
President?
Go!
Chris Kelly: As you can see, it's a probability of what is to be labeled in the football field, from the perspective.
You might have realized that you lack people, the rest of the team.
We have a video of them, correspondent from Washington University.
Camp March: Rats 54." Real 54."
Blue eight, Blue eight. Go!
Chris Kelly: This is a little more likely to be in the field, but there's nothing to do with being at NBA.
The fans want that experience.
The fans want to be in the field, to be their favorite players and have asked me in YouTube and on Twitter, you can see from the angle of a field marker.
Or a road?
We want to experience that."
Once we have that experience with Goddie and Google Glass, how do we get it up? How do we take it to the next level?
We took it to that level using something called Eurosaur Richard, which is surely a lot of you know.
The Richard Richard has been described as the most realistic virtual reality apparatus ever, and it's not cheap word.
And I'm going to show you why, with this video.
Man: Oh, oh.
No, no, no. I don't want to keep playing. No!
Oh, my God! Ah!
CK: That's the experience of a man in a Russian mountain looking for his life.
What will be the experience of a fan when we remember a video of Adrianne Peters crossing the line, getting rid of a marker with the arm before running and making a solution? What will be the experience of a fan.
When it can be Messel running through the car, launching the bullet at the bottom of the network? Or Federal making a said in Williams?
What will be your experience when you go from a mountain to over 100 miles as a space scanner?
Maybe you have the sandwiches for adults.
But this is not even augmented reality.
It's just virtual reality, R&D.
How do we get augmented reality, OK?
We will get augmented reality when the coaches and the dropping and the owners see the information of what people want to see and think, "How do we use this to improve our teams better.
How do we use it to win paradise?
Because they always use technology to win.
They like to win. They give them money.
So, here is a brief story about technology at NPL.
In 1965, the Battle of Baltimore put a search for their field marketing to play faster.
They won the Super Bowl that year.
Other teams decided to imitate them.
More people saw the game because it was more exciting, faster.
In 1994, the NPL put radio in the hull of the fields of fields and then in the defense.
They had more spectrums because it was faster, more entertaining.
In 2030, imagine you're a player coming back to your group, and you see their next game shown in front of you, in a plastic visit that takes place -- you don't have to worry about forgetting a game.
Or to memorize the strategy.
They just go into the field and react.
And the coaches want it because if they don't follow their instructions, they lose parties, and they hate losing parts.
If you lose parties as a coach.
And they don't want that.
But the augmented reality is not just a better strategy manual.
augmented reality is also a way to collect information and use it in real time to improve your way to play the game.
How would it do?
Well, a very simple option would be to have a camera in every corner of the stadium having a view from how high people are down.
You also get information from the sensors of the hull and the accelerometer.
And all that information is sent to your players.
Good teams will know to send them.
Bad people will have a lot of information.
This will difference the good teams of bad equipment.
So your computer team will be as important as your records, and the data analysis will stop being just for nerves.
Who would have imagined it?
What would it be in the field?
Imagine that it's the field marker.
You get the bullet and the contrast.
All of a sudden a party on the left side of your bombsight will warn you that a defense behind you is going to attack you, usually you wouldn't see it, but the RNA system will warn you.
Move forward to the protection.
Another flower warning you there is an open receptor.
You launch the ball.
And Ebola loses the trajectory.
You don't know where to land. However, the receptor sees in its bombsight an area of grass that is lit and can modify the race.
It's about it, they catch the ball, running and analysis.
The audience is and the fans have followed the player from every angle.
This is something that will create massive emotion on the game.
I'll make lots of people see it, because people want to live that experience.
The fans want to be in the field.
They want to be their favorite player.
The fact that it was really increased to be part of the sports because it's too profitable to not be.
But what I ask you is, we want this to be the only use of augmented reality?
Are we going to use it just as bread and circus as our useful entertainment?
Because I think we can use it for something else.
I think we can use the augmented reality to foster the empathy between human beings, to show someone how it is, literally being in the place of another person.
We know what this technology is worth for sports legs.
It generates billions of income per year.
But how much is this technology going to be a teacher in the classroom trying to show an abuse how harmful their actions are from the perspective of victim?
How much is this technology worth for a gay in Uganda or Russia trying to show the world how it lives being presented?
How much is it going to be a Hansarchin Congress or a Neil Debase Testing trying to inspire a generation of children to think more in space and science instead of quarterly and Karaini" notes.
Ladies and gentlemen, the augmented reality.
The questions we make, the decisions we take and the challenges that we face, they depend on, as usual, from us.
Thank you.
I recently retire after 23 years of service in the California Patrolia Harvard.
Most of those 23 years was I spent the southern end of the South Marine County, which includes the Golden Gate.
The bridge is an iconic structure, known as the beautiful view of San Francisco, the Pacific Ocean and the architectural style.
Unfortunately, it's also an imam for suicide, being one of the most used places in the world.
The Golden Gates Bridge was open in 1937.
Joseph Street, engineer chief to build the bridge, said that, "The bridge is practically a suicide test.
The suicide from the bridge is no practical or probability."
But from their openness, over 1,600 people have jumped to their death from that bridge.
Some of you believe that traveling between the two towers will take you to another dimension -- this bridge has been identified as such, so that the fall of it frees you from all your concerns and pain, and the waters that go down under your soul.
But let me tell you that it happens when the bridge is used to commit suicide.
After a four to five seconds, the body drops against water about 120 miles an hour.
The impact broke the bones, some of which are presenting vital organs.
Most people die in impact.
The ones that don't normally stand in the helpless water, and then they drowned away.
I don't think that those who control this subject method will realize the death of death that they will face.
This is the wire.
Except around the two towers, there are 32 parallel steel inches to the bridge.
This is where most people are for before they take their life.
I can tell you for experience that once the person is on that edge, and in their darkest moment, it's very difficult to bring it back.
I took this picture last year while this young man talked to an officer contemplating his life.
I want to tell you about joy that we had success that day in bringing it back into the ballot.
When I started working in the bridge, we didn't have any formal training.
We struggled to channel the way through these calls.
This was not just a bad service to those who control suicide, but the officers as well.
We've come a long way since then.
Today, veteran and psychological officials train the new offices.
This is Jason Garden.
I met it on July 22 last year by receiving a call from a possible suicide subject sitting in the corruption near the center.
I said, and when I arrived, I looked at Jason talking to a Google Gate officer.
Jason was only 32 years old, and he had flown up here from New Jersey.
In fact, I had flown up to here twice before New Jersey to try to sound from this bridge.
After about an hour talking to Jason and asked us if we knew the story of the Pandora's box.
remembering the Greek mythology Zen created Page, and he sent her to the Earth with a box, and he said, "No, you never open that box.
Well, one day, curiosity could more than Pandell, and she opened the box.
It was going out of it, singer, and all kinds of bad ones against the man.
The only good thing in the box was hope.
So Jason asked us, "What if you open the box and there's no hope?
They stopped a few instruments, leaned on the right, and it was gone.
This wonderful girl and smart man in New Jersey had just taken his life.
I talked to the parents of Jason that night, and I guess when I was talking to them, it didn't seem to be ringing very well, because the next day, the family rabbi called me to see how it was.
Jason in Jason had asked it.
The coastal damage of suicide affects many people.
I ask you these questions: What would you do if a member of your family, a friend or someone loved out supported?
What would you say?
Would you know what to say?
In my experience, you don't just have to talk, but you have to listen.
Listening to understand.
Don't argue, cultive, or tell the person you know how they feel, because you probably don't know.
Just being there, you can be the point of inflection they need.
If you think someone is suicide, you're not afraid to confront and ask the question.
One way to ask you the question is, "Do you think in the similar circumstances, have you thought about taking your life, you've had these thoughts?
Confirming the person in front can save life and be the tipping point for them.
Other signs to look for despair, to believe that things are terrible, and they're never going to improve -- impossible, believe that there's nothing you can do about it. social isolation, and a loss of interest in life.
I came up with this talk just a couple of days ago, and I got an email from a lady and I'd like to read you your letter.
She lost her son on January 19 of this year, and he wrote this email just a couple of days ago, and he is with his permission and her leaves that I read them.
Hi, Kevin -- I imagine you're at TED conference.
It must be a whole experience to be there.
I'm thinking that I should go to foot this weekend.
I just wanted to leave a note.
I hope you can tell many people and go home talking about it to their friends who tell their friends, etc.
I'm still quite inspiring, but I'm going to notice more moments to realize that Mike won't go home.
Mike was driving from Peter to San Francisco to see the party of the 49 with his father in January.
He never got there.
I called the Peter police and repeated it as a disappeared night.
The next morning, two officers came to my house and reported me that Mike car was down in the bridge.
A witness had seen him jump out from the bridge at 1950 in the late day before.
Thank you very much for fighting for those who can be temporarily too weak to fight for themselves.
Who hasn't been previously wrong without suffering a real mental illness.
It should not be so easy to end with it.
My prayers are with you for your struggle.
The GG: The Golden Gold Bridge is supposed to be a passage through our beautiful bay, not a cemetery a cemetery in the table.
Good luck this week, Vichael."
I can't imagine the value that she needed to go to the bridge and regain the path that his son took that day, and also the value to go forward.
I'd like to introduce you to a man who I mean with hope and value.
On March 11, 2005, I responded to a radio call for a possible subject in the bridge of the bridge near the northern tower.
I drove my motorcycle on the sidewalk, and I looked at this man, Kevin Berkeley, standing in the sidewalk.
When I saw me, he crossed the railing and stopped in that little tube that goes around the tower.
Over the time and a half, I heard as Kevin talked about its depression and despair.
Kevin decided that day that day will come back on that lane and give life another opportunity.
When Kevin came back, the happiness.
"This is a new beginning, a new life."
But I asked him, "What did you make you go back and give hope and life another opportunity?
And you know what was told me?
He said, "I heard me.
I let me talk and just listen to it.
Shortly after that incident, I got a letter from the Koto mother, and I have that letter with me, and I would like to read it.
"Dear Berly Bradles, nothing erase the events of March 11, and you are one of the reasons why Kevin goes on with us.
And honestly, I think Kevin was clear for help.
It's been diagnosed with a mental illness for which it's been properly medical.
I adopted Kevin when I was only six months old, completely unconscious of all those heroic traits, but thank God, we now know.
Kevin is in order, as he says.
We give God for you.
And honestly, with you, Nather Berkeley."
And at the end she wrote, "D.C. when I visited the General France Hospital that night, you signed like the patient.
"I know I had to solve it.
Now, Kevin is a curious father and active member of society.
It speaks openly about the events of that day and their depression with the hope that their story will inspire others.
Subject is not just something that I've found in the work.
It's personal.
My grandfather was suicide with poison.
That act, despite finishing his own pain, I stole the opportunity to know it.
This is what suicide does.
For most people suicide or those who consider suicide, they wouldn't think about taking another person.
They just want their own pain to go.
Typically, this is just about three things: sleep, drugs or ancient death.
In my career, I've answered and I've been involved in hundreds of mental illnesses and suicide calls around the bridge.
Of those incidents that I've been directly involved, I've only lost two, but those two are too much.
One was Jason one.
The other one was a man who told him about an hour.
During that time, I was holding my hand in three times.
In the final order, I looked at me, and he said, "Kevin, I'm sorry, but I have to go."
And he jumped out.
Horrible, absolutely awful.
I want to tell you, though, that the vast majority of people we get to contact in that bridge are not supported.
Also, those few people who have jumped out of the bridge and lived and that you can talk about it, that one one or two percent, most of those people have said that the second one who stopped the signal they realized they had made a mistake and they wanted to live.
I say to people, the bridge doesn't only connect Mars with San Francisco, but also people.
That connection, or bridge that we do, is something that everybody and each of us should strive to do.
suicide.
There's help. There's hope.
Thank you very much.
The world makes you what you're not, but inside you know what you are, and a question makes you, how do you become that?
I have to be something unique in that sense, but I'm not alone, in any way I'm alone.
When I became a model I felt that I had finally achieved the dream that I had had since a child.
My outside was finally matched with my inner truth, with my inner self.
For complicated reasons, I'm going to tell you later, when I look at this picture I think, you get General, you get it, you get it.
But the West October, I discovered that I'm just starting to start.
Everybody elements us our families, our religion, our society, our moment in history, even our bodies.
Some of them have the value of releasing, to get rid of the limitations tax by the color of skin or by the beliefs of who they surround us.
They're people who always defy the status quo -- which is considered acceptable.
In my case, the last nine years, many of my neighbors, many of my friends, my agent, even ignored my story.
I think this enemy is called revealing.
This is mine.
I was registered as a child when I was born because of the appearance of my genetics.
I remember my five years in Philippines, in my house, I was always wearing this shirt on my head.
And my mom asked me, "Why are you always taking that t-shirt in your head?
I said, "Mom, it's my hair. I'm a girl.
I knew how to support it.
The gender has always been considered an immune fact, but now we know that, really, it's something more complex and mysterious now.
Because of my success, I never dared to share my story, not because I think what I'm bad, but how the world is treating those of us who want to liberate them.
Every day I appreciate being woman.
I have mom, dad and a family who accepted me as I am.
Many are not so lucky.
There's a long tradition in the Asian culture that celebrates the mystery of gender.
There's a Buddhist goddess of compassion.
There's a Hindu goddess of the sands.
And when I was eight years old, I was on a party in the Philippines who celebrated these mysteries.
I was in front of the stage, and I remember that this beautiful woman appeared to me, and I remember that moment as if something hit me, this is the kind of woman I would like to be.
And when I was 15 years old, I met this woman called TED.
It's the director of a transmission of transportation beauty.
That night she asked me, "Why haven't you involved in beauty conscious?
He told me that if he participated she would get rid of the inspiration and the self-exploration, and that night, she won in board of bathroom and she was going to be the third end of over 40 candidates.
That moment changed my life.
Suddenly, I was in the world of beauty.
Not a lot of people can say that their first job was of beauty of transmission of transportation women, but I can.
I also met the damage of the devices, especially when we traveled to remote provinces of Philadelphia.
But more importantly, I met my best friends of that community.
In 2001, my mom -- who had moved to San Francisco, called me and told me that they passed my position of the green card.
I was resistant.
I said to my mother, "Mommy, I'm fun.
I'm here with friends, I like to travel and be a beauty retina."
But then, two weeks later, he called me and said, "You know if you move to the United States, you can change the name and the identity of gender.
It was all I needed to hear.
My mom suggested to me that I put two or my name.
She also accompanied me when I was in Thailand at age 19.
It's curious that in some of the most rural cities in Thailand they perform the most prestigious surgery, sophisticated and safe.
At that time in the U.S., it was necessary to make surgery before changing the name and the gender.
So in 2001, I went to San Francisco, and I remember looking at the driver's driver's license.
It was a great moment.
For some people, their identity documents means power or power to get a short, but for me it was the license to live to feel worthy of it.
Suddenly, my fears were minimized.
I felt that I could conquer my dream and move to New York, and it will be model.
Many are not so lucky.
I think of this woman named La Telescope Leonardo.
A young woman in New York who was completely living his truth, but that, disappeared, put end to his life.
For many of my community, that's the reality that they live.
Our suicide rates are eight times higher than the rest of the population.
Every 20 of the November, we do a global flu for the Congress Day of Transportation.
I'm on this stage because of a long story of people who fought and stood down to the injustice.
These are Marshall P. Johnson and Sylvia River.
Today, right now, I'm coming out of the closet.
I can't keep living my truth alone and just for me.
I want to do the best to help others live their truth without shame.
I'm here, exposing me, so that some day no longer is there in the late 20 of November.
My deepest truth led me to accept what I am.
Will you do that?
Thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.  KT: Generation, a quick question.
George Rock: Sure. You see, first, thank you with all my legs.
In my support network, my parents especially, to my family, who is very strong.
I remember all the times I've murdered young women transitions, who I've been hated, and sometimes when they called me and told me that their parents couldn't accept it; I would take the phone, I would call my mom and say, "Mom, can you call this woman?
Sometimes it worked, others. It's just gender identity, that's what's in the center of what we are, right?
I mean, we all have a gender at birth, and what I'm trying to do is put on the table that sometimes that supporting non-state say, and that there should be a space that allows people to adapt to, and this is a conversation that we should have with parents, with colleagues.
The shipping movement is getting compared to the gay movement.
There's still a lot of work to do.
I should have understanding.
There should be space for curiosity and to ask questions, and I hope that all of you are my allies.
KS: Thank you. Very kind. GG: Thank you.
In many patriarchal and tribal societies, parents usually know for their children, but I'm one of the few parents who know for their daughter and I'm proud of it.
Malaya started his campaign for education defending his rights in 2007. And when their efforts were holding up in 2011, when you get the June National Prize of peace, it became very famous, a very popular girl in his country.
Before that, it was my daughter, but now I'm his father.
Ladies and gentlemen, if we take a look at the history of humanity, the history of women is the history of injustice -- inequality, violence and exploitation.
You see, in the patriarchal societies, right from the beginning, when a child, their birth is not celebrated.
It's not welcome -- not for your father, or your mother.
The neighborhood comes down, gives her controllers to the mother and no one happy to the father.
And a mother was overwhelmed by having a child.
When you give birth to the first girl, the first daughter, it gets sad.
When you give birth to the second daughter, it gets excited, and with the hope of a son, when you put your third daughter, it feels guilty as a criminal.
Not just the mother suffers, but the daughter -- the newborn daughter was born, when it grows, it was also suffering too.
At the age of five, when I should go to school, it stays at home and school admit to its brothers.
Until the age of 12, in a way, it has a good life.
You can get fun.
It can play with your friends on the street, and you can move through the streets as a butterfly.
But when it comes into the teenager, when it comes up 13 years old, it gets protected to come out of his house without a male accompanies.
It's confined to the four walls of their house.
It's no longer a free person.
It becomes the honor of his father and his brothers and his family, and if he passed the code of that honor survey, he could even kill it.
And it's interesting that this assumption code of honor is not only affecting a girl, it also affects the life of male members of the family.
So this brother, sacrificed the joy of his life and happiness of his sisters in behalf of the honor of the honor.
And there's one more norms of patriarchal societies called obesity.
It's supposed to be a good girl must be very quiet, very humble and very sustainable.
It's the criticism.
The model of a good girl must be square.
It's supposed to be silent and accept the decisions of their father and their mother and the decisions of the elderly, even if you don't want it.
If you marry it with a man who doesn't like or if you marry it with an old man, you have to accept it, because it doesn't want to be delicious device.
If you make it very young, you have to accept it.
Otherwise, they will call it debris.
What happens at the end?
In words of a poet, "The Mars, the finance, and then gives birth to more children and daughters."
And the irony of the situation is that this mother, including the same lesson of obesity to his daughter and the same honor lesson to his children.
And this vicious circle goes on and on.
dear brothers and sisters, when Malaic was born -- and for the first time, believe me, I don't like the newly born, to be honest, but when I was there and looked at his eyes, trust me, I felt incredibly honored.
And so much before I was born, I thought about his name, and it was fascinated with a legendary fireflies of freedom in Afghanistan.
His name was Malawi from Maddama, and he called my daughter like this.
But when I went down, they were all men, and I grabbed my pen, and I took a line from my name, and I wrote, "Malahi."
And when she grew up, when she was four and a half years old, he was in my school.
You might wonder, why should I mention a girl in a school?
Yeah, I should mention it.
You can take it in Canada, in the United States, in many developed countries, but in poor countries, in the patriarchal societies, in tribal societies, it's a great event for the life of children.
In a school that means the recognition of their identity and his name.
An admiration to school means that he's entered the world of dreams and aspirations where they can explore their potential for their future life.
I have five sisters, and none of them could go to school, and they would be surprised, two weeks earlier, when I was able to see the Canadian vision, and I was in the relative part of the family, I couldn't remember the approved of some of my sisters.
And the reason I had never seen the names of my sisters written in any document.
That was the reason I value my daughter.
What my father couldn't give my sisters or his daughters, I thought I had to change it.
I used to appreciate the intelligence and the sandwich of my daughter.
I encouraged it to sit with me when my friends came to me.
I encouraged me to go with me at different meetings.
And all of these values, I've tried to instill them in their personality.
And this wasn't just for Malaice, just for Malaic.
I've implemented all these good values in my school to girls and boys alike.
I used education for emotional.
I teach my daughters, teach students, to forget the lesson of obesity.
I teach students to forget the lesson of the subject called subject.
dear brothers and sisters, we fought for more rights for women, and we struggled to have more and more space for women in society.
But we found a new phenomenon.
It was lethal for human rights, and in particular, for women's rights.
It was called the california.
That means a complete denial of women's participation in all political, economic and social activities.
Hundreds of schools were lost.
The girls were banned to go to school.
Women were forced to use veil, and they stopped going to markets.
The musicians were silent, the square girls and the singing singers.
They were suffering millions, but a few people talk, and it was terrifying to have those people who kill and store when you talk about their rights.
It's really frightening.
By the age of 10 years old, Malawi came up with the right to education.
He wrote a newspaper for the BBC blog, she was offered herself for the New York Times documentaries and he talked about every platform he could.
And his voice was the most powerful voice.
It's spread as a climate around the world.
And that was the reason that the Taliban couldn't tolerate their campaign and January nine 2012, they shot up in his head.
It was a family day for my family and for me.
The world became a great black hole.
Whereas my daughter was delivering between life and death, I whispered the ear to my wife, "Should I blame me for what happened to my daughter, to your daughter.
And he initially said, "Please don't blame you.
It defines the right cause.
You put your life on play for the cause of truth, because of the cause of peace, and because of the cause of education, and your daughter inspired in you and joined you.
They were both on the right path and God protected?
These few words meant a lot for me, and I didn't ask again.
When Malawi was in the hospital and had severe pains and strong headaches of head because his facial nerve was cut, I used to see a dark shadow that was extended by the face of my wife.
But my daughter never complained, though.
I used to say, "I'm well with my smile tone and with my face.
I'm going to be okay. Please don't worry.
It was a consumption for us, and we were consuming.
Headaches and sisters, we've learned from it how to resist in the hardest moments, and I'm pleased to share with you that despite being an icon for the rights of children and women, it's like any 16 year-old girl.
He cried when he didn't finish his task.
It fights with his brothers, and I'm very happy for that.
People ask me, "What's special in my tutor that has done so audacious to Malaic so valuable, expressive and emotion?
I say, don't ask me what I did.
Ask me what I didn't do.
I didn't cut your wings and that's it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
I was operated from the brain 18 years ago, and since that day, the science of the brain has become a personal passion.
I'm engineering.
And I want to tell you that I recently joined the Google group of Google, where I've had a divide to my charge -- the visualization of Google X -- but all the work that I'm talking about today about brain science -- I did before I joined Google or outside my work there.
Having said this, there's a stigma when you get to a brain operation.
Are you still as smart or not?
Not being like this, could you be smart.
After the neuroscience, I was missing a part of the brain, and I had to live with it.
It wasn't the gray matter, but it was the sticky part of the center that creates important hormones and neuroscientists.
Immediately after the operation, I had to decide how much to take, from more than a dozen chemicals every day, because if I didn't take anything, it would die in a few hours.
Every day, for the last 18 years, I've had to decide about combinations and mix mix and try to get them to stay alive.
More than one time I've saved me.
But luckily, I have an experimental soul, so I decided that I would experience to try to get the optimal doses because there isn't really a clear map that says it in detail.
I started testing different mixes and I was surprised by looking at how small changes in the doses changed dramatically my autonomy, my sense of who I was, my way to think, my behavior with others.
A particularly impressive case, for a few months, I tried doses and typical chemicals for a man of two, and I was surprised by seeing how my thoughts changed.
I was always functional, I thought all the time in sex, and I thought it was the smartest person around the world, and --  -- of course, many times in the past I've known a number of things like this, or maybe some stories in the past.
It turned out to be an extreme.
But my great surprise was that I wasn't trying to be a rode.
In fact, I was trying to be trying to fix a problem that had the front, and it simply doesn't happen.
So I couldn't manage it.
I changed my doses changed.
But I think that experience gave me a new appreciation about men and what they have to go through. Since then I get better with men.
What I was trying to do -- by embracing those hormones and neurosciences and so on, was to recover my intelligence after disease and operation, my creative thought, my flow of ideas.
I tend to think almost always in images, and that became my key reference point -- how do I get those mental images that I used to create prototypes, my ideas, if you want to try and try new ideas and recreate situations.
These kinds of thoughts is not new.
Philosophers like Human, Descartes and House see things like this.
They thought that images and mental ideas were the same thing.
There are those who question this idea, and there are a lot of discussions about how the mind works, to me is simple: for most of us, mental images are fundamental to creative and investment.
So after several years, I managed to find the point right and have lots of great mental images, really volunteered, well sophisticated and good structures.
Now, I'm working on how to bring these mental images, from my mind to the computer screen.
Can you imagine what happens if a movie director is able to use its imagination only to steer the world that has the front?
Or if a music could extract the music of his head?
There are incredible possibilities with this, as the way that creative people can get to share the speed of light.
And the truth is, the only difficulty to do this is simply increasing the resolution of our brain scanning systems.
Let me show you why I think we're pretty close to get to this with two recent experiments done by two groups in neuroscience.
They both used MRI technology, image for functional MRI -- to represent the brain. Here you can see the brain scan done by Girl Gandhis and his colleagues from Harvard.
The column on the left shows the brain of a person who looks at an image.
The media column shows the brain of the brain of that same individual as you imagine, seeing that same image.
The column on the right is created by restoring the content of the central column of the left -- you see that the difference is almost normal.
This is repeated in many different individuals with lots of different images, always with a similar outcome.
The difference between seeing an image and imagine to see that same picture is almost normal.
Now, let me share another experiment. This is the lab of Jack Gallo in Berkeley, California.
They managed to convert brain waves into recycled visual fields.
Let's put it this way.
In this experiment, he showed people hundreds of hours of YouTube videos while they were escaped their brains to create a great deal of brain reactions to video sequences.
Then, I showed you a film with new images, new people, new animals, and as much as a new scan was recorded.
The computer, using just the brain information of the scan that was described to show what seemed like the person was seeing.
On the right, you can see the computer decorations, and on the left, the video I showed you.
This left us anti-decisions.
We're well close to it.
We just need to improve resolution.
And now, remember that when you see an image, and when you imagine that same image, it creates in the brain the same map.
This was conducted by the brain scanning systems of the largest resolution today, and their resolution is increasing as a thousand times in the last few years.
Now we need to increase the resolution about a thousand times to get a deeper look.
How do we get it?
There are many techniques to do that.
One is open up the skull and introduce electrodes to it.
I won't offer me for that.
Many of you are proposing new techniques for images, even me. Tell you about the recent result of IMAX, first we have to ask the next thing, this technology will be the end of the way?
The conventional wisdom says that the only way to get greater resolution is with larger images, but at this point, larger magnets just offer small improvements in resolution -- don't increase for thousands as we need.
I propose this idea: instead of bigger images, we do better images.
We can create much more complex structures with slightly different corridors like making a spirit.
And why does this matter?
In the last few years, a lot of effort at MRI were to make really big images, right?
However, most recent advances in resolution of ingenious and brilliant solutions in coding and decompinities, in the transportations and frequency frequencies of FM radio systems in MRI systems.
At the same time, instead of a uniform magnetic field, we use magnificent magnetic patterns taken to the FM radio frequency.
So by combining the magnetic patterns with the patterns of the FM radio processing processing -- we can increase massive form of information that can be extracted in a single scanned.
Also, we can then divide our growing knowledge about the structure of brain and memory to create the increase in the thousands we need.
By using IMFir we should be able to measure not just the old blood fluid, but the hormones and neuroscientists I've mentioned and maybe even the direct neural activity -- this is sleep.
We will be able to fly our ideas in a direct form to digital media.
Can you imagine if we could go over the language and communicate directly by thinking about it?
What would we be capable of?
And how do we learn how to deal with the truths of human thinking without filter?
You thought the Internet is a big thing.
These are big questions.
It would be inside to use it as a tool to amplify our skills of thinking and communication.
Certainly, this same tool could lead to the cure of Alzheimer's and diseases.
We have few choices more than open this door.
Anyway, choose a year, will happen in five or 15 years?
It's hard to imagine that I'll take a lot more.
We have to learn how to give this step together.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you tonight about getting out of the closet, not in a traditional sense, not just the gay army alone.
I think we all have arms.
Your closet, maybe you will tell some person for the first time you love it or tell someone who is pregnant, or telling someone to have cancer, or any other conversation that you have come through in life.
All army is a difficult conversation, and even though our issues can be vary, tremendously, the experience of having lived and out of that closet, is something universal.
It's fear, and we don't like it, and it must happen.
A lot of years ago, I worked on the South Side Walk, a restaurant in the city, and being there, I had to go through a number of stages of the intensity of space microscope," not to rate my armpits, quote the letters of Ann Dad as a letter.
And I'm going to be aware that because of the holiday of my short pants and I had to get my head out of my head, I would ask a little boy, "Hey, you're a boy or girl?
And it would appear an awkward silence on the table.
I would take my jaw a little bit more, I would take my coffee with a leave of radio.
The father would huge the newspaper and the mother would launch a cold look at his son.
But I wouldn't say anything, and I would hold inside inside.
And I got to the point that every time I went to a place where there was a child between three and 10 years, I was ready to fight.
And that's a terrible feeling.
So I promised that next time I would say something.
It would have that difficult conversation.
So after a few weeks, it happened again.
"Are you a kid or a girl?
A family silence, but this time was prepared and I was about to go into the female issues on the table.  It had Betty French quote.
Global StevenaZe quote.
Even a fragment of the "Vagina Monologues," I would show you.
And so I breathe up and I went down the look and my back a four-year-old girl with a pink dress, looking at what is not a challenge for a feminist drought, just a girl with a question, "Are you a girl or a girl?
And so I breathe around again, I put it up close to her, and I said, "Hey, I know this is a confusing thing.
I have the short hair like a boy, and I saw a boy clothes, but I'm a girl, and you know, like you like to use a pink dress, and sometimes you like to use a comfortable pajamas.
Well, I'm more than the guy of a comfortable piece."
And that girl looked at me sight, paying attention, and he said, "My favorite pajamas.
Can you give me a painting, please?
And that was it. Just "Oh, OK. You're a girl.
What about the swamp I asked?
It was the easiest conversation of all that I've ever had.
And why? Because the girl of the penguin and I, both of us were honest with the other.
So as many of us, I've lived in some lunch in my life, and yes, often, my walls used to be an archive.
But inside, in the dark, you can't know what color is the walls.
You just know how you feel like living in a closet.
That's how my closet, it's not different than yours or yours or you.
I'm sure I'm going to give you 100 reasons why out of my closet, it was harder than coming out of it, but this is the thing: The hard thing is not relative.
The hard thing is hard.
Who can tell me to explain to someone who have been declared in broken bank is more difficult than telling us it's been dentarched?
Who can tell me that this story that I tell is more difficult than telling your five years to be distributed?
There's no more difficult thing, there's only the hard.
We need to stop taking care of what is difficult to do about what difficult for another person to make us feel better or worse in relation to our closet, and we should just feel empathy because we all live a difficult thing.
At some point in our lives, we all live in arms, and they may make sure feel security, or at least more security than the other side of the door.
But I'm here to tell you, no matter what their walls are, a land is not a place to live.
Thank you.  Imagine yourself 20 years ago.
I, who had a horse tail, a dress and a high incarceration shoes.
It was not the military lesbian prepared to fight any four year-old child who would enter the coffee.
I was frozen by fear in a corner of my dark closet pushing my great gay graduate, and moving only a muscle is the most scary thing I've ever done.
My family, my friends, complete strangers that I've spent my entire life trying not to disappoint them, and now the world came back to purpose.
I was burning the pages of a script that we've all followed for so long, but if you don't release that big, you will kill you.
One of my most memorable launches was in my sister's wedding.
It was the first time that many between the guests knew that it was gay, and by doing my honor labels, in my black dress and tapestries, I walked around the tables and finally came to one where my parents were in my parents, people who knew me to do years ago.
And after speaking a moment, one of the women said, "I love Nathan Langua.
And the gay rate battle had started.
"Ah there ever were in the Cash?
"Well, yeah, the truth is that we have friends in San Francisco.
"Well, we've never gone there, but we've heard it's fabulous."
"Ah, you know my anti-cancer stability?
It's very good and never talked about having never."
"Ah, what is your favorite TV program?
Will our favorite program world and Grace.
And you know who love us? Jack is?
Jack is our favorite favorite."
And then a woman, discovered but in hope to show desperately his support, to make me know that I was from my side, finally said basically, "Well, sometimes my husband uses pink cameras."
And I had an opportunity at that time, as you have all the grandmated landscapes.
Sure, it might have been easy to indicate where they felt head.
It's not very hard to find them and realize the fact that they were stuck.
And what else can you ask someone, but start?
If you're going to be authentic with somebody, you have to be prepared for the authentic you get.
This is how the hard conversations continue without being my strong point.
Ask anyone who I have come out.
But I'm getting better, and I follow what I like to call the three principles of the Girl Girl.
Now, please see this through gay perspective, but they understand that what it means to get out of any arm is essentially the same.
Number one: Audience Be authentic.
Take the armor out. Be yourself.
That girl in the coffee had no armor but I was ready for the battle.
If you want somebody to be genetic, the other ones have to know that we also suffer too.
Number two: Be direct. Just give him a number two, and they play your parts.
If you know that they're gay, to tell you.
If they say to their parents that maybe they might be gay, they will keep the hope that that could change.
Don't give you a sense of false hope.
And number three, and more important.  Let the complex.
You communicate your truth.
They never apologize to that.
And some of you can go out there safe, forgive you for what you've done, but you never apologize to what they are.
And yes, maybe some of you will feel disappointed, but that's something in them, not you.
Those are the expectations of them about what you are, but not your own.
That's the story of them, but not from you.
The only story that matters is that you want to write.
So the next time you find in a dark dragonic supporting a graduate, you must know that we've all been there before.
And you may feel very alone, but they're not.
Thank you, Bolo. Enjoy the vehicle.
Intelligence, what is that?
If we look at the story of how intelligence, a productive example has been the famous quote of Mr. Disconnect that "The question of whether a machine can think of is as interesting as the question of whether a submarine can swim.
When Mr. Federal wrote this as a criticism to the computer pioneers like Alan Turking.
And so, a few years ago, I started a program to try to understand the fundamental physical mechanisms of intelligence.
Let's go back a step.
First, let's start with a mental experiment.
Imagine you're from an alien race, which you don't know about the biology of Earth or neuroscience of Earth or Earth intelligence -- but they have incredible telescopes, and you can see the Earth, and they have incredibly long lives, so you can see the Earth for millions, even billions of years.
And you see a very strange effect.
Of course, as terrorists, we know that the reason would be that we're trying to save ourselves.
We're trying to avoid an impact.
But if you're from an alien race that doesn't know anything about this, that it doesn't have any concept about intelligence on Earth, you would see forced to develop a physical theory that would explain how, until a certain time in time, the asteroids that demonstrate the surface of a single planet they stop doing it.
And so I claim that this is the same question that the physical nature of intelligence.
So in this program that I conducted several years ago, I analyzed a variety of topics through science, through various disciplines, which would come in, I think, to a single underlying mechanism of intelligence.
In cosmology, for example, there has been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be finally adjusted to the development of intelligence, and, in particular, for the development of universal states that maximize the diversity of possible future.
Finally, in robotic motion, there has been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to harness the skills of robots to maximize the future freedom of action in order to perform complex tasks.
And so by taking all these different issues and putting them together, I asked, for several years ago, there's a underlying mechanism for the intelligence that we can extract from all these different issues.
Is there just an equation for intelligence.
And I think the answer is yes. What you're looking at is probably the closest equivalent of one and to me for the intelligence that I have seen.
So what you're seeing here is a claim that intelligence is a force -- F that acts in order to maximize the future of action.
It acts to maximize the future freedom of action, or keep open choices, with a force T, with the diversity of possible future authorities, yes, to an impending amount of time, taken off.
In a few words, intelligence doesn't like to stay stuck.
intelligence tries to maximize the future freedom of action and keep open options.
And so, having this equation, it's natural to ask, "What can you do with this?
How predictable is it?
Does we predict the level of human intelligence predicting?
Does artificial intelligence predict artificial intelligence.
So I'm going to show you now a video I think, showing some of the amazing applications of this simple equation.
Narrator: Recent research in cosmology have suggested that the universes that produce more destroyed, or electrode, in their life should have tendency to more favorable conditions for the existence of intelligent beings like us.
But what happens if that collective collective connection between entropy and intrinsic intelligence is a deeper relationship?
What if intelligent behavior is not only correlated with the long-term production production, but actually emerges directly from it?
In order to figure out, we've developed a software engine called Entertaining, designed to maximize the production of long-term entropy in any system that is in the inside.
Amazingly, Entertainment could pass multiple animal intelligence tests, playing human games, and even making money trade action, all of that without that it would have been told to do that.
Here are some examples of Entertainment in action.
Just like a human foot without chance, here we see Entertaining equipping automatically a painting using a cart.
This behavior is remarkable in part because we never gave English a goal.
He just decided to be able to balance the post.
This ability of equilibrium will have applications for human robotics and human assistance technologies.
This ability to use tools will have applications in smart manufacturing and agriculture.
In addition, just like some other animals can cooperate pulling away from extremes from a rope at the same time to release food, here we see Electric can perform a version of the model of that task.
This capacity of cooperation has interesting consequences for economic planning and in a variety of other fields.
Entertainment is widely applicable to a variety of dominances.
For example, here we see it successfully playing a play game against itself, illuminating its potential for play.
So here we see Entrepreneus organizing new connections in a social network where friends are constantly disconnected and keeps successfully the Web well.
This same network of network architecture also has applications in health care, energy and intelligence.
Here we see English organizing the routes of a boat fleet -- discovering successfully and using the Panama Canal to expand global level in the Atlantic to the Pacific.
In the same way, entropy is widely applicable to problems in autonomous defense and logistics and transportation.
Finally, here we see Edgellar spontaneously discover and execute a business strategy, sell in a simulated series of actions, successfully increasing assets under its experience exponentially.
This ability of risk management will have broad applications in finance and safe.
Alex Giussani: What you've seen is that a variety of brands of intelligent cognitive behaviors such as the use of tools, walking upright and social cooperation, all derive from one equation, which leads to a system to maximize its future freedom of action.
Now, here's a profound irony here.
So let's go back to the beginning of the actual term use, the "Bruno play, there was always the concept that if we developed smart machines, there would be a cyber rebellion of it.
The machines would be lifted against us.
One of the biggest consequences of this work is that maybe all these decades, we've had all the concept of cyber rebellion to investment.
It's not that machines first become smart and then members and try to get to the world.
It's all the opposite of it, that the impulse of taking control of all possible future is a more fundamental principle than the intelligence of intelligence, that general intelligence can actually arise directly to take control, rather than being backwards.
Another important consequence is the pursuit of the target.
And I often ask me, how do you look for goals to get away from this kind of mark?
My equivalent to that statement to go through the descendants to help us build artificial intelligence or to help us understand human intelligence, is this: intelligence must be seen as a physical process that tries to maximize the future freedom of action and avoid the constraints in its own future.
Thank you very much.
We're at an inflection point in human history, something between the contract of stars and losing the planet we call home."
Although, in the last few years, we've expanded our knowledge of how Earth fits in the context of the universe.
NASA mission of NASA has discovered thousands of possible planets orbiting other stars, which points to the Earth is just one between the billions of planets of our galaxy.
Kepler is a space telescope that measures the luminous intensity of stars when planets go through them, and they block a little bit of that light that comes in.
The data collected by Kepler show the sizes of planets in addition to the distance between them and their stem star.
In contrast, this helps us understand whether these planets are small and rock like the land planets of our solar system, and also the amount of light they receive from their sun.
In turn, this gives you clues about whether these planets that we find are habitable or not.
Unfortunately, while we're finding this potentially habitable world, our own planet is hiding under the weight of humanity.
2014 was the most hot, recording catastrophe.
Glass and ice ice that have been with us from thousands now are disappearing in a matter of decades.
These environmental changes that we have caused to global scale have been rapidly overcome our ability to alter their course.
But I'm not a climate scientist, no astronomer scientist.
I study the ability of the planet influenced by stars, with the hope of finding places in the universe where to discover life beyond our planet.
You could say that it looks for alien opportunities in the housing sector.
Now, as someone really interested in the search for life in the universe, I can tell you that the more I seek planets similar to Earth, more enjoy our own planet.
Each of these new worlds invited a comparison between the planet recently discovered and the planets that we know better."
Take our neighbor, Mars.
Mars is small and rock, and despite being a little bit further from the Sun, it can consider a potentially habitable world demonstrated this by a mission like Kepler.
In fact, it's possible that Mars has been habitable in the past, and in part, that's why we studied so much to Mars.
Our Rover like the "discourage is tracking their surface in search of clues about the origins of life as we know it.
The satellites that orbit it, like the Maliba mission, take samples of the atmosphere -- and try to understand how Mars has been able to lose their ability.
private companies now offer not just short space flights but also the chance to live on Mars.
But even though all these brown images remind us to the deserts.
Let's take the spread of the desert areas of our planet that are still going to collect, really exclusive places in comparison with Mars.
Even in the smallest and most elevated places of the Earth, the air is fresh and filled with oxygen explosive by our tropical forests to thousands of miles away.
I worry that this excitement by the violence of Mars and other planet planets have a big and sad shoulder -- the implications and belief of some that Mars will expect to save us out of this influence of the only planet that we know that it's truly habitable the Earth.
And so I like intellectual exploration, I'm deep down with this idea.
There are a lot of good reasons to go to Mars, but say that Mars will be there to save humanity is like imagining that Titanic captain will tell us that the party will actually have place later in the wild.   Thank you.
But the targets for international exploration and terrorist preservation is not contradiction.
No, they're actually faces of the same coin, the goal to understand, preserve and improve life in the future.
The extreme environments present in our world love as extraterrestrial pannels.
They're just closer to home.
If we can understand how to create and maintain habitable spaces, in the hostile areas and injustice areas of the Earth, maybe we can satisfy the need to preserve our environment and go beyond that.
Let me leave you with a mental experiment -- Ferring paradox.
A lot of years ago, the physicist Enrico Fermi asked me to realize that our universe has existed for a long time, and we hope that there are many planets in this universe, we should have found evidence of alien life existence so far.
Well, where are they?
Well, one possible solution to Fermi paradox is that when civilizations become technologically advanced enough to consider to keep living between stars, they lose the notion of how important it is to protect the origin of planets that made this development.
It is arrogant to think that only unacceptable colonization, we will save ourselves from ourselves, but planetary preservation and intellectual exploration can work together.
If we really believe in our ability to support the hostile environments of Mars for human presence, then we should be able to overcome the even easier task to preserve the standard on Earth.
Thank you.
A few years ago, I took my own house.
And as I was on the front porch looking at my pockets, I realized I didn't have the keys.
In fact, I could see the window they were on the dining table, where I had left them.
So quickly I tried to open all the other doors and windows and all of them were well closed.
I thought about calling a close, at least I had my cell phone, but to midnight, a deer could take a lot of time to come in, and I was cold.
I couldn't go home from my friend of Jeff to spend night because I had an early flight to Europe to the next morning, and I learned from my passport.
It would be expensive, but sure that I don't know more expensive than a middle of a night at night, so I thought, despite the circumstances, I went out pretty well.
I'm a professional neuroscientist, and I know a little bit about how the brain works under stress.
It releases the heart rate that increases heart rate, modulate levels of adrenaline and number of thinking.
And when I got to the facility counter at the airport, I realized I didn't have my passport.
Well, I had a lot of time to think about those eight hours without sleep.
And I started asking myself, if there was something that I could do, systems that could put in their place, that will prevent bad things.
Or at least, if bad things happen, that minimize the probability that it's a total catastrophe.
So I started thinking about that, but until a month later, my thoughts were not criminalizing.
I was dinner with my colleague Danny Kanzis, winner of the Nobel Prize, and a little bit embarrassed I told him that I broke the window, and I had forgotten my passport. And Danny shared with me that had been practicing something called a protocopy restriction.
It's something that he had learned from the psychologist Gary Kenya, who had written this a few years before, known as the prize.
Everybody knows what the prototype is.
Every time there is a disaster, a team of experts comes and tries to figure out what went wrong, right?
In the prize, as Danny explained, you look forward and try to figure out all the things that you might go wrong, you try to figure out what you can do to prevent things up or to minimize damage.
So what I want to talk about with you is some things that we can do in the form of a prize.
Some of them are evidence, others are not so evident.
I'm going to start with the obvious.
In the house, it will take a place for things that are easily lost.
This sounds like common sense, and it is, but there's a lot of science that supports this thesis -- based on how our space memory works.
There is a structure in the brain called hippocampus, which has evolved over thousands of years, to make a tracking of the location of important things, where the good is right, where the fish are the fragmented trees, where tribes live and enemy trials.
The hippocampus is the part of the brain that is grateful in London.
It's the part of the brain that allows the squirrel to find their nuts.
And if you ask if someone really did the experiment, they cut the old sense of the squares and yet they could find their nuts.
They didn't use the soldier, but the hippocampus, that very evolved mechanism in the brain to find things.
But it's really good for things that don't move much, not so good for things that move a lot.
This is the reason for losing cars, reading and passengers.
So at home they get a place for the keys, a hook next to the door, maybe a decorative dish.
For his passport.
For their reading goggles.
If you go into a place and you're struggled with it, your things will always be there when you look for them.
What about the trips?
Take the cell a picture of their credit cards, driver's license, passion, send them down for themselves to be in the cloud.
If these things lose or steal them, this can facilitate sustainability.
These are some of the most obvious things.
Remember, when it's under stress, the brain releases corruption.
The court is toxic and entropy thinking.
So part of prime practice is to recognize that under stress, we're not going to be at the best time, and you have to put the systems in your site.
And there's perhaps no more stressful situation than when you face a medical decision.
And at some point, we will all be in that situation, to have to make a very important decision about the future of our medical care or a loved one, to help them with a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And I'll talk about a very particular medical condition.
But this is wrong as a process for all of medical decisions, and in fact for the financial decision of social decisions and social decisions, any kind of decision you have to take from which you would benefit a rational assessment of facts.
So suppose you go to the doctor and the doctor says, "I've got the result of the lab and the cholesterol is a little high."
You all know that the high cholesterol is associated with a greater risk of cardiovascular disease, heart attack, brain.
So you're thinking that having the high cholesterol is not the best, then the doctor says, "I'd like to prescribe a drug that will help you reduce the college, a state."
And maybe you have heard about the statistics, and you know that it's one of the most recent drugs in the world today -- even it's likely to meet people who take them.
So you think, "Yes, record the state."
But there's a question that you should do then, a statistics that is supposed to be asked from which most doctors don't want to talk, and the pharmaceutical companies even less.
It's for NASA, the number needed to treat.
And what is this, the NGOs:
It's the number of people who have to take a drug or join a surgery in any medical procedure before they help a person.
And should you think what kind of described statistics is that?
The number must be one.
My doctor wouldn't remind me if I wasn't going to help me.
But actually, medical practice doesn't work like this.
And it's not culture of the doctor, and if it's guilty of somebody, it's about scientists like me.
We haven't understood very well the underlying mechanisms.
But the Global estimates that 90 percent of drugs work only about 30 to 50 percent of people.
So the number need to treat the most widely regulated state, what do you think it is?
How many people have to take it before they help a person?
300.
This is according to the research of cynical researchers Jerry Google and Paul Harry, confirmed independently by Blues.
I myself explore the numbers.
300 people have to take the drug for a year before they avoid a single heart attack, brain death or another adverse event.
Now you may think, "Well, one probability in 300 of us will go down my cholesterol college.
Why not? Doctor? Give me the recipe anyway.
But then you have to ask for a more statistics, and it is, "Get out of the side effects. Yeah?
For this particular drug, side effects are produced by five percent of patients.
And those include terrible things -- definitely painful muscle pain and articulate pain, but now you think, "My five percent is not very likely to happen to me, still take the medicine."
But a moment.
You remember that under stress don't think about clarity.
So think about how you look at this over time, so you don't have to make the chain of reasoning.
300 people take drugs, right? A person has helped you, five percent of the 300 have side effects, that's 15 people.
You have 15 times more likely to go out of the drug that you help your drug.
I don't say they should or not take the status.
I just say that you must have this conversation with your doctor.
The medical ethic requires it, it's part of the informed consent principle.
We have a right to have access to this kind of information to start the conversation about whether you want to take risks or not.
You may be thinking that I've launched this number in the air by the value of the crash, but actually this number that you need to treat is quite typical.
For the surgery that it is in the older men in 50, extension of prostate prostate cancer, the number needed to treat is 49.
That's what it is, 49 surgeries for one person who's helped me.
And the side effects in that case are produced by 50 percent of patients.
Those include the power or the British distribution, the primary incident, the straight legal, fecal incident.
And if you have lucky luck, and you're one of that 50 percent of the effects will only take a year or two.
So the idea of prize is to think before time the questions that you can plan to push the conversation forward.
You don't have to make all of this in the act.
And they also want to think about the quality of life.
Because you have a choice many times, you want a shorter life free of pain, or a longer life than could you have a lot of pain towards the end?
These are the things you talk about and think about now, with your family and your loved ones.
You can change you in the heat of the moment, but unless you're trained in this kind of thought.
Remember, our brain releases under stress, and one of the things that happens at that moment is that a lot of systems.
There's an evolutionary reason for this.
Face to face with a predators, you don't need the digestive system, or the life or the immune system, because if your body is spending metaphorical in those things, it doesn't react to rapidly, you could get the lunch of lions so that none of that matter.
Unfortunately, one of the things that comes out of the window during those moments of stress is the rational logical thinking -- like Danny Kanzier and his colleagues have shown.
So we have to train ourselves to think about the future to these kinds of situations.
I think the important thing here is to recognize that we are all definiteroses.
We're all going to fail at the time.
The idea is to think of the future how they might be those fails, to put systems in the place that will help us minimize damage, or to prevent the bad things happening in the first place.
Reporting the night of snow in Montreal -- when I came back from my journey, my contractor installed me a combination of combination next to the door, with a key of the entry door in the same one, an easy way to remember it.
And I have to admit that I still have lots of letters that I haven't ordered -- and lots of email messages I haven't read.
So I'm not very organized, but I see the organization as a gradual process, and I'm doing it.
Thank you very much.
Interpreter: Pixami, "Phan is my favorite musical symbol.
It means playing some source.
If you're playing a musical instrument and you see a stage in the score, you need to play more gently out.
Two p.m., even more soul.
Four peace, extremely south.
This is my drawing of a player tree, there you see it doesn't matter how many thousands and thousands of peace there may be, you will never get to a complete silence.
That's my current definition of silence, a very dark sound.
I'd like to share a little bit about the history of the American system, the ASHA, besides a little bit of my own story.
The language of French signs came up during the 1800s, and over time, it mixed with local signs and developed the language we know as ASLA.
So it has a story about 200 years.
I was born deaf, and they taught me to believe that sound wasn't a part of my life.
And I thought it was true.
However, I realize that it's not true for anything.
Sounds are a very important part of my life, they're really in my mind every day.
As a deaf person who lives in a sound world, it's like I lived in a foreign country, following their rules, communications, behaviors and norms without questioning them.
So how do you understand sound like?
Well, I see how people behave and respond to sound.
People are like my alphabets and they amplify sound.
Learning and copied that behavior.
At the same time, I've learned that I can create sounds and I've seen how people respond to it.
So I've learned for example.
"Don't read the door."
"Don't do a lot of noise when you eat the bag of free passengers."
"Don't error, and when you're eating, you make sure you're not going to go into the cover in the plate."
This is all called sound "education."
Maybe I think of sound tag more than the average person does it.
I'm a survey of sound.
And I'm always waiting with nervous nervous senses, about which is coming next.
From there, this drawing.
TEDx to decide.
TED, to continue.
TED, to announce it.
You can see that the print doesn't have notes on the lines.
That's because lines already contain sounds through subtle and banks and banks.
In deaf culture, movement is equivalent to sound.
This is the signal for "The Island in the Alhambra.
A typical print has five lines.
However, to me, to do my thumb that doesn't feel natural.
That's why in my drawings, I just have four lines on the paper.
In 2008, I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin, Germany, for an artistic resistance there.
Before this time, I had worked as a painting.
During this summer, I visited museums and spaces of different galleries and while I went from one place to another, I realized that there was no visual art there.
At that time, the sound was the trend and that called me the attention.
There was no visual art, it was all audio.
Now the sound has entered my art land.
Is it going to distance me more than art?
I realized it doesn't have to be like this.
In fact, I know sound.
I know it so well that it doesn't just experience through ears.
I can feel it any touch or experience it visually, or even like an idea.
So I decided to reclaim the property of sound and integrate it in my artistic practice.
And everything that had taught me about sound, I decided to leave it and defend it.
I started creating a new body of work.
And when I presented it to the artistic community, I was impressed with the amount of support and attention I got.
I realized that sound is like money, power, control, social currency.
At the bottom of my mind, I always felt that sound was oblivious -- it was something from a heart person.
And the sound is so powerful that it could be delivered to me and my artistic work, or I could be empowered.
I chose that I'm going to get worse.
There's a massive culture around the spoken language.
And just because I don't use my literal voice to communicate, the eyes of society is like I didn't have a voice at all.
So I have to work with people who can support me from equal to the same and become my voice.
So I'm able to be relevant to the current society.
So in school, in the work and the institutions, I work with many different performers from ASPA.
And his voice becomes my voice and identity.
They help me be heard.
And their voices have value and weight.
Ironically, when you borrow your voices, I'm able to keep a temporary form of value something like taking a loan with a very high rate of interest.
If I didn't continue this practice, I feel that I could get rid of the forgotten and not have any kind of social value.
So with sound like my new artistic medium, deep in the music world.
And I was surprised by looking at the similarities between music and ALS.
For example, a musical note can't be captured and expressing on the paper.
And the same thing can tell you about a concept in ASHA.
The two are very space and highly mutational companies that means that subtle changes can affect all of the signals as the sounds of sounds.
I'd like to share a metaphor of the piano, so that you understand better how the ASHA works.
So imagine a piano.
The ASHA is divided in many different grammar parameters.
If you assign a different parameters for each finger while you touch the piano, like the facial expression, the body movement, the speed, the shape of your hand, and so while you touch the piano, English is a linear language, like it would be just a team at a time.
However, the ASHA is more like a chord -- you need the 10 fingers in a similar way to express a clear or idea of Islam.
If only one would change the chord. It would create a completely different meaning.
The same thing happens with music in terms of tone, family and volume.
In ASHA, using these different glamorous parameters -- you can express different ideas.
For example, the sign force in that."
This is the sign in that."
I'm looking at you.
Look at me.
Oh, they laughed.
Oh.
What are you looking for?
Ah, it's going."
So I started thinking, and if I look at the ASHA through the lenses of music?
If I had to create a sign and repeat it over and over again, it could be like a piece of visual music.
For example, this is the "day of "Da: the sun comes out and it goes.
This is all day."
If you repeat it and reduce speed, it's visually seen as a piece of music.
All day.
I feel that the same thing can tell you about "All night.
"All night.
This is all night in this drawing.
And this led me to think about about three different types of nights, "Jack: "But at night,  "All night.
I feel that the third is more musical than the other two.
This represents how time in ASHA and how distance the body can express changes in time.
For example, one hero. It's a hand, two holes, it's two hands, the present gets closer and in front of the body, the future is in front of the body, and the past is in the back.
So the first example is a long time ago.
Then, "I would happen, "It is "a for -- and the last one, which is my favorite, with a very romantic and dramatic idea at once, "I was once once.
Common time is a musical term with a specific rate of four times by companies.
However, when I see the word "monitoring time, I automatically think at the same time.
Look at Mother: right hand -- MIT, hand hand.
We have the screen through the head and the chest.
(Audience: Med, "Pharan "graph -- "Time Commons" -- MIT, I'm going to teach you a form of your hand called "Fabmer "Earth."
Can you do it with me?
Everybody with their hands in high.
Now we're going to do it as much in the head as the chest, something like common time, or "the same time."
Yeah, very good.
That means "Look at the international system.
The international system, as a note is a visual tool to help communicate in all cultures and sign languages around the world.
The second one I'd like to show you is this one. Please do it again.
And now this.
It means "Colonialism in the Alhambra.
Now, the third one. Please make me again.
And again.
It's "limbing ALS.
We're going to do the three together.
"Look "in "Look," colonialism and "limbing."
Good job.
Look at how the three signs are very similar, they all happen in the head and the chest, but they transmit very different meanings of meaning.
It's amazing to see how the ASHA is alive and prepared, just like music.
However, today, we live in a very American world.
And only because the ASHA doesn't have sound, automatically doesn't have social value.
We have to start to question what defines social value and allow the ASHA to develop its own value, without sound.
And this could be a step to make a more inclusive society.
And maybe people will understand that you don't have to be deaf to learn AILL. You don't have to hear to learn music.
The ASHA is a rich, and I would like you to have the same experience.
I'd like to invite you to open your ears open, open your eyes, to participate in our culture and experience from our visual language.
And you never know, you can even fall in love with us.
Thank you.
Denni Kalen? Hey, that's me.
As a child, my parents said, "You can put it all up, but then you have to clean it."
freedom involves responsibility.
But my imagination took me all these wonderful places, where everything was possible.
So I grew up in an innocence bubble or a business bubble I have to say, because adults lie to us from the awful truth.
When I get older, I learned that adults are also excited and they're not really good at cleaning the others.
The time country, now I'm an adult and I teach citizen and invention at Hong Kong.
You don't have to wait a lot for my students to walk through the beach.
So as good citizens, we cleaned the beach, and no, it's not black bandwidth, and if it is, I didn't give it.
It's sad to say, but more than 80 percent of the oceans contain plastic.
It's a startup thing.
And in the last few decades, we've been coming out with these big barriers and networks, to collect those plastic bits to study them under the microscope, and we classify them and collect this information on a map.
But it lasts an eternity and it's very expensive, and it's also very risky to use those huge boats.
So along with my students, with ages of six to 15 years, we dream to invent a better way.
We've transformed our tiny classroom in Hong Kong in a workshop.
So we started building this work of work with advanced height so that children very low can also participate.
And I'm going to tell you, the kids who manipulate electrical tools are really cool and secure.
Not exactly.
Let's go back to the plastics.
We collect the plastic and we reduce it to the size that we find it in the ocean, which is very small, because of its fragment.
That we do.
I leave it to the imagination of my students.
My job is to try to take the best ideas in every child and try to combine them into something we expect it to work.
We decided instead of collecting bits of plastic, we will just collect information.
By using a robot, we take an image of this plastic, the kids are very excited about robots.
Then we quickly created what we call "a prototype.
We're so fast in the creation of prototypes that we end before lunch.
And we transform light lamps and cameras in access and we assemble it in a floating robot that will move slowly through the water and the plastic we have there, and this is the image captured by the robot.
We see the bits of plastic floating slowly through the sensor while the onboard computer process this image and measure the size of each particle to get an estimate estimate of the amount of plastic in the water.
We document this last step in a website for inventors called "The Institute: with the hope that someone else even more.
The great thing about this project is that the students saw a local problem, and boom, they're trying to fix it immediately.
"I can investigate my local problem, but my students in Hong Kong are very well informed kids.
You see the news, they eat the Internet, and they get together with this image.
A child, maybe less than 10 years, cleaning a oil spill. Just using the hands, in Sunday, the largest mangrove rainforest in Bangladesh.
They were very surprised because this is the water that drink -- it's the water in which they go in, the water where they fish, the place where they live.
You can also see that water is brown and the mud and the oil are also a brown color, and when everything is mixed up, it's very hard to see what is in the water.
But there's a simple technology called Spring, which allows you to see what's in the water.
We built a first prototype of a pen that can light through all kinds of substances that produce different species, which can help identify what's in the water.
We took this prototype with a sensor and sent it to Bangladesh.
The great thing about this project is that beyond solving a local problem, or analyzing a local problem, my students use their empathy and their sense of creativity to help other children.
"I can investigate a problem at a distance -- I was forced to do a second experiment, and I wanted to go a little bit further, maybe I would address a more difficult problem, and also closer to me.
I'm half Japanese and half French and maybe remember, that in 2011, there was a devastating earthquake in Japan.
It was so violent that they took a lot of giant waves, called the tsunami, and those theaters destroyed several cities on the coast of Japan.
Over 14 thousand people died in a second.
It also gives the nuclear power plant of Futuri, a nuclear central center to the water.
And today, according to the reports an average 300 tons are still leaking from the nuclear plant in the Pacific Ocean.
Today, the whole Pacific Ocean has contraction traces by Benjamin."
If we go to the west coast, we can measure the radiation of Australia everywhere.
But if you look at the map, it seems that most of the radiation disappeared from the Japanese coast, and most of the time, it has a safe aspect of it, is blue.
Well, reality is a little bit more complicated than that.
I've gone back to Australia every year from the accident and researching independently with other scientists, the land, the river, and this time we wanted to take children.
Of course we didn't take them, parents didn't allow them.
But every night we informed the control center -- here you see the use of different muscles.
It might seem like they didn't take the work seriously. But they did it because they are going to have to live with radiation all their lives.
Together with them we discussed the data collected that day and we talk about what we were going to do later, the strategies, the intelligence, etc.
And to do this, we created a rudimentary map of the region around the nuclear energy plant.
We created the elevation map, we introduced pigments to represent data in real time of radiation, and we record water to simulate the rain.
And we could notice that the radioactive powder was filtering from the top of the mountain to the book system, and it was demonstrating in the ocean.
It was an approach starting.
But based on this we organize a civil expedition -- the closest to nuclear central to date.
We approached up to 1.5 miles away from nuclear school, and with the aid of fishermen in the area we were collecting sediments of the sea milk with a serious surgeon tracking as we invented and built.
Here we see a programmability: we've gone from a local problem to a remote problem, a global problem.
And it's been very exciting to work on these different scales, also with open source technologies and very simple.
But at the same time, it's been increasingly frustrating because we've only been starting to measure the damage we've done.
We haven't even started trying to solve problems.
I wonder if we should give the leap and try to invent better ways to do all these things.
So the classroom became a little bit small, so we found an industrial installation in Hong Kong and we turned it into the largest space dedicated to social and environmental impact.
It's at the center of Hong Kong and it's a place where we can work with wood, metal metal, chemistry, a little bit of biology, optics, basically, you can build almost all over there.
It's also a place where adults and children can play together.
It's a place where children can become reality with adult aid, and where adults can be kids again.
Students: Accept. Action."
Cerisis Harvard: We asked things like, can we invent the future of mobility with renewable energy?
For example.
Or can we help in the mobility of advanced population, transforming their standard wheelchair in new electric vehicles.
Plastic, oil and radiation are terrible legacy -- but the worst legacy we can leave our kids to be the lies.
We can't afford to protect the children of the awful truth, because we need their imagination to invent the solutions.
So, scientific citizens, creators -- creatures, we must prepare the next generation to be concerned about the environment and people, and so that I can actually do something about it.
Thank you.
Two twin cells, two radically opposite cultures.
One is made of thousands of pieces of steel, the other one of a single silk line.
One of them is synthetic -- the other organic one.
You care about the environment, the other one creates it.
One is designed by nature, the other one.
Michael angel said that when he looked at the mouse in broccoli, he saw a figure that was fighting for being free.
The quote was only a many Minister of Milo Angeles.
But living beings are not cycled.
They grow.
And in the smallest units of life, the cells, we took all the information to take it for every cell to work and to replicate it.
The tools also have consequences.
At least from the Industrial Revolution, the world of design has been dominated by reactions of manufacturing and mass production.
The assembly lines have dictated a world made of parts, consuming the imagination of designers and architects trained to think about their objects as a set of discrete parts with different functions.
But you don't find morality students in nature.
Think about the human skin, for example.
Our facial skins are thin with dialected pore.
The skin skin skins are more thick with little pores of it.
You act primarily as a filter, the other mainly as a barrier, and yet, it's the same skin -- there's no parts -- there's no statements.
It's a system that is going gradually its functionality through the variation of space.
Here's a divided screen that represents my view of the divided world, the double personality of every designer and architect to work right between the bottom and the gene, between the machine and the gene, between the transparency and the growth, between the assembly and the growth, between Henry Ford and Charles Darwin.
These two visions of the world, my left hemisphere and the right, analysis and synthesis -- is shown in the two screens behind me.
My work, at its simplest level, tries to unite these two visions of the world, getting out of the assembly and accelerating growth.
You probably ask yourself, why now?
Why couldn't it be possible about 10 or even five years ago?
We live in a very special moment in history, a rare moment, where they confront four discipline that offers designers to the tools that we never had access to before.
And in the intersection of these four fields, my team and I create.
Please know the minds and the hands of my students.
We designed objects, products and structures and tools through scale, of great scale, like this robotic arm with a 24 meters of diameter with a visceral basis that someday not very far to print whole buildings and graphics to nanoscale manufacturers that shine in darkness.
Here we have reinvented the cell, an archetype of ancient Arab architecture, and has created a screen where every oil is about unique size to model the shape of light and heat through it.
In our next project, we explore the possibility of creating a layer and a failure. This was for a fashion rate of Paris with Iran van Heroscos, and it's like a second skin made from a single piece -- reduced in the containers, flexible around the waist.
Together with collaborative 3D printing collaborators, we printed this layer and it was missing 3D without cost between the cells. I'll show you more objects like that.
This helmet combines rigid and soft materials in the resolution of 20 minutes.
This is the resolution of a human hair.
It's also the resolution of a CCT scanner.
That designers have access to this high resolution, and the synthetic instruments allow us to design products that are not just the shape of our bodies, but also the physiological structure of our tissues.
We've also designed an acoustic chair, a chair at the time structure, comfortable and also absorb sound.
Professor Carter -- my collaborator, we went back to nature to inspire them, and by designing this irregular surface pattern, it becomes subjective.
We printed this surface of 44 different properties, which vary in regime, opportunity and color, corresponds to pressure points in the human body.
Their surface, as in nature, is worth its functionality not through the addition of another material or another thing, but it is continuously varied and defined the material property.
But is the ideal nature?
No parts in nature?
I didn't grew up in a religious Jewish home, but when I was young, my grandmother told me stories about the Hebrew Bible, and one of them was left and came to define a lot of what I mean.
As she relates, "In the third day of creation, God sent the Earth to grow a fruit crazy tree tree."
For that first fragile tree, there would be no difference between traffic, branches and leaves and frustrated.
The whole tree was a fruit.
Instead, the land was growing trees with branches and cortex, streets and flowers.
The Earth created a world made of parts.
I often ask me, "What would design would be if the objects were made from one piece?
Will we go back to a better state of creating?
So we look for the biblical material, the kind of material tree of fruit with fruit and we find it.
The second most abundant biologist on the planet is called ratio, and about 100 million tons are produced every year by organisms like shrimp, cardiosis, shocking and butterflies and butterflies and butterflies and butterflies and butterflies and butterflies and butterflies and butterflies and butterflies and butterflies and butterflies and butterflies and butterflies and butterflies and butterflies and butterflies and butterflies and butterflies and butterflies and butterflies and butterflies and butterflies
We thought that if we could tune their properties, we could generate multi-touch structures in one piece.
So that's what we did.
We call it legal marketing.  We asked a lot of cartoons to shrimp, we moved them and produced tapirg.
Several chemical concentrations have been able to achieve a broad range of properties, from dark, hard and opaque to light, soft and transparent.
To print the large-scale structures, it was built a system with multiple extraordinary extraction nozzle.
The robot could vary the properties of the material on the march and create these structures made from one material about 30 feet long, 100 percent recycled.
When the pieces are ready, they let them dry to find a natural shape to the contact with air.
So why do we keep designing plastician?"
The air bubbles that were a propositional process of printing was used to contain physical microscopes that appeared for the first time on the planet 3.5 billion years ago, as we heard yesterday.
Together with our collaborators at Harvard and MIT, we increase the bacteria genetically designed to capture the atmosphere of the atmosphere and turn it into sugar.
For the first time, we have been able to generate structures that make their transition without problems of ship, and if it's even more, to windows.
A free crazy free tree tree.
Working with an ancient material, one of the first forms of life on the planet, with abundant water and with a little bit of synthetic biology, we've transformed a structure made of shrimp care in an architecture that behaves as a tree.
And here's the best part: for objects designed to biology, put in the sea, feed marine life, and put in the ground, help grow a tree.
The advancement for our next exploration using the same design principles was the solar system.
We look for the possibility of creating clothes to keep the lives for the interplanetary travel.
To do that, we must dominate bacteria and control their flow.
So as the periodic table -- we made our own element of elements: new forms of life created computing and managed to form additive and increase biologically.
I like to think of synthetic biology like liquid animal, only that instead of transmitting precious metals -- they synthesize new biological officials within very small channels.
This field is called microbial.
We printed our own 3D channels to control the flow of these liquid bacterial crops.
In our first piece of clothes, they combined two microbes.
The first is the circulation.
It lives in our oceans and on fresh water.
And the second, E. he collected, the bacteria that inhabit the human intestine.
You convert the light into sugar, the other consumed sugar and produces useful biofuels.
But these two microbes don't interact in nature.
In fact, they never met.
They're here, designed for the first time, to have a relationship in a piece of clothes.
Think about it as evolution, not by natural selection, but evolution for design.
To contain these relationships, we've created a single channel that resembles the digestive tract that will help them flow these bacteria and get their way up in the way.
So we started to grow those channels in the human body, and we have the properties of the material on the desired function.
If we wanted more photosynthesis, we designed more transparent channels.
This profitable digestive system, when you stretch from one end to another, you would get 60 meters.
This is half the length of a football field, and 10 times more than our head stored.
And here it is, as a prime at TED, our first powerful photographer, channel liquid channels in the clothing.
Thank you.
Mary Sheave said, "We are past creatures, only half of it is done.
What if design would provide the other half the other half.
What if we could create structures that increase living matter?
What if we could create personal microbes that would scan our skin, repair the damaged tissue, and they would hold our bodies out?
Think about this as a way to edit biology.
I call this the material ecology.
For that, you have to go back to nature.
Now, you know that a 3D printer will print material on layers.
You also know that nature doesn't do this.
It grows up. It adds to sophistication.
This gun cooking for example, for example, creates a highly sophisticated architecture, a home inside which is metaphorically.
Now non-state manufacturing.
It does it through combination not from two materials, but two proteins in different concentrations in different concentrations in different ways.
An act like structure, the other is the glue or the matrix, using those fibers each other.
And this happens through scale.
The silk worm first gets lost in the environment, creates a tension structure, and then it starts to hit a copies of compression.
tension and compression. The two forces of life, they manifest in a single material.
In order to understand better how this complex process works, we put a small magnet to the head of a silk worm to the hill.
We put it inside a box with magnetic sensors, and that allowed us to create this cloud of dots in three dimensions and visualize the complex architecture of the silk worm of silk.
However, when we put the silk worm on a flat patch -- not within a box, we realized that he would smell a flat cooking and still methane means.
So we started designing different environments, different scaffolding and we've discovered that the form, the composition of the cocoon -- is transmitted directly by the environment.
You often have the silk worms to death inside your coffee, your silk gets rid and used in the textile industry.
We saw that designing these plants, we can shape the silk silk without boiling a single copy.
They are multiplying unfortunately, and we could create these things.
So we climb this process up to the architectural scale.
We had a pilot robot doing silk plans, and we put ourselves in our site.
We knew that silk worms migrate to more dark and cold areas -- so we used a solar route diagram to reveal the distribution of light and heat in our structure.
So we create holes or authorities, to block the rays of light and heat, distribute silk worms about structure.
We were prepared to get the chess.
We asked 5,000 worms of silk to a online farm.
And after feeding them four weeks, they were prepared to helicopter with us.
We placed them carefully at the bottom of the scaffolding and as they swollen up, criminalizing, came up, they put eggs, and life begins again, like us, but much, much more short.
Buckminster Fuller said that tension is the great integrity and he was right.
The hill biological silk on the silk silent roles, they give all this pavilion its intelligence.
And in a little more than two or three weeks, 5,000 silk worms take 5,000 miles.
In a curious symmetry -- this is also the length of the silk route.
The polescasis, after the election, produce 1.5 million eggs.
This could be used for 250 extra balls in the future.
So here are the two visions of the world.
A line silk by a robotic arm, the other filling vacuum.
If the last frontier.
Which brings us back, of course, at the beginning.
Here is a new era of design, a new era of creation, which brings us from an inspired design in nature to an inspired nature in design, which demands from us, for the first time, that we make us charge of nature.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Raise your hand if you've ever asked you "What do you want to be from the biggest?
If you had to remember what age you had when you first asked them this?
You can show it with your fingers.
Three. Five. Three. Three. Five. Five.
Now, raise your hand if the question is, "What do you want to be from the biggest?
It's caused some kind of anxiety.
Any anxiety.
I'm somebody who never could answer the question, "What do you want to be from the biggest?
The problem wasn't that I had no interest, but I had too much.
In school, I liked English, the slaughter and the art and developed web sites, and also, he played the guitar in a band point called Telecommunic Freud.
You may have heard about us.
And generally I like to try and persist anyway, to have spent a lot of time and energy and sometimes money in this field.
But over time this sense of boredom, this sense of boredoo, this is no longer a challenge, it comes to me.
And I have to leave it.
But then I care about something else, something completely different, and I get up in it, and I'm going to let me absorb and feel "in "Yes: I've found my mine," and then again this point where I start getting bored again.
And finally, I want to leave it.
But then I'd like to discover something new and different, and I'd like to go into that.
This pattern caused me a lot of anxiety, for two reasons.
The first one was because I wasn't sure how it was going to turn all this into a career.
I thought I had to choose one thing, deny all of my other passions and give me bored.
Another reason why I was so much more personal.
I was worried that there was something wrong about this, and something bad in me because I would not be defined by anything.
I was worried about having fear of engagement, or to be wake, or assumption or my own success.
If you can relate my story and these feelings, I would like to ask you something that I would like to have been blown in.
Ask themselves, where they learned to assign the meaning of evil or abnormal to do things.
I'll tell you where they learned it, they learned it from culture.
We are wondering, "What do you want to be from the biggest?
When we have about five years.
And the truth is that nobody cares about what you tell that age.
It's considered an naive question to make cute answers in children like, "Be astronomer: or "be dancer, or "I want to be perfect."
Look at the seat of Hillis here.
So this question is done again and again as we grow up in different ways, poster, existence, high school students are asked you are going to choose in college.
And at some point, "What do you want to be from the biggest?
It happens to be the cute exercise of before what sleep takes us.
Why?
While this question inspired children to dream with what they might be, I don't inspire to dream with everything they might be.
In fact, just the opposite of it, because when someone asks you what you want to be, you can't respond with 20 different things, even though you were really excited about you are laughing and say, "Oh, what cute, but you can't be an artist of violence and psychological artists.
You have to choose."
This is Dr. Bob Children  and he is artistic and psychopathic.
And this Amy Nino, editor editor turned into illustration, entrepreneurs and teacher and creative director.
But most kids don't hear about people like this.
All you hear is they're going to have to choose it.
But it's more than that.
The notion of focused life is very idealistic in our culture.
It's this idea of fate, or the real voice, the idea that each of us has something to do for their time in this land, and you have to figure out what that thing is and dedicate your life to it.
But what if you're somebody who's not connected in this way?
What happens if there are many different issues that wake up their curiosity and many different things that want to do?
There's no place for someone like one in that frame.
And so you can feel alone.
You can feel that you don't have a goal.
And feeling there's something wrong with you.
There's nothing wrong in you.
You're a multiplication.
A multiplication is someone with many interests and creative activity.
It's a bank for it.
It could help if it's divided in three parts: multiple and potential and dad.
You can also use other terms that connect the same idea, as a freedom, refused.
During the time of Renaissance, the ideal was who was well seen in multiple disciplines.
Barbara Sheru refers to us as sensory.
They use any term they like or invent one itself.
It seems like a species to adapt to a community, we can't agree with one identity.
It's easy to look at multiplicity as a limitation or a and a choice that you should see.
But what I've learned by talking to people and writing about these ideas on my website, is that there are huge strengths to be this way.
Here are three multiple supermarkets.
One: ideas of ideas.
I mean, the combination of two or more fields and creating something new in the intersection.
Shang Hans and Rachel Binnett expressed their shared interests in cardiologist, visualization of data, travel, mathematics and design, when they started Mesocketime.
Mescause is a company that creates geographically inspired jewelry.
And Rausin and Rachel came up with this unique idea for its eclectic mix of skills and experiences.
Innovation happens in intersections.
That's where new ideas.
And the multiplications, with all their agencies, can access a lot of these points of interaction.
The second mobility superpower is fast learning.
When the multiple of us are interested by something, we're going to it.
We look at everything we can have in our hands.
We are used to be principle, for having been a lot of times in the past, and this means that we have less afraid of testing new things and coming out of our comfort areas.
Many skills are transferred to other disciplines, and we bring everything we've learned to every new area that we have, so we rarely start from scratch.
Norway Dono is a full-time journey, independent writing.
As a child pannel perfectly persuaded an incredible ability to develop muscle memory.
Now, she's the fastest known mechanism.
Before I became a writer, Norway was financial planning.
He had to learn the most fine sales mechanics when he started his practices, and this ability helps him write compelling launches for publishers for publishers to write them out.
It is rarely a loss of time to go to what you get to you, even if you finally abandon it.
It's possible to apply that knowledge in a completely different field, in a way that you could not have anticipated.
The third multinational superpower is adaptation. That is, the ability to transform into anything you need in a given situation.
Abe Captain is sometimes a director of videos, other websites, websites, sometimes consumer from Kickstarter, sometimes teacher, and, sometimes, apparently James Bond.
It's valuable because it does a good job.
He's even more valuable because he can assume different roles depending on the needs of his clients.
The Facebook Magazine Company defined adapting as the most important ability for development, to thrive in the 21st century.
The economic world changes so rapidly and unpredictable that they're the individuals and organizations that can be able to be able to meet the needs of the market, the ones that will actually be proposed.
And ideas of ideas, quick learning and adaptable, three skills where multiplicity are very adept and three skills that could be lost if they're ready to reduce their goals.
As a society, we have a great interest to foster multiplicity to themselves.
We have complex problems, multiplications right now, and we need creative creative thinkers.
Let's say they are, in your heart, specialists in your heart.
They came out of the belly knowing that they wanted to be a pediatric neurosurgeon.
Don't worry, there's nothing wrong in you either.
In fact, some of the best teams are composed from a specialists and a fuel multiplication.
Specialists can dive deep and put in practice ideas, and the multinational offers a broad of knowledge to the project.
It's a beautiful relationship.
But we should all design lives and careers that are going to make the way we are connected.
And unfortunately, the multiplicity in large parts are encouraged to be more like their specialized partners.
And I once said this, if there's one thing that you take about this talk, I hope it's this: reconstruction with the internal warming, whatever it is.
If you are a heart specialist, then you specialize for all the media.
That's where you will give the best.
But for multiplicity in the room, including those who just realized to be one of them in the last 12 minutes,  I say, "Relying with their many passions.
They follow their curiosity for those consumers of contractor.
They explore the interactions.
And embracing our inner wiring leads us to a more authentic and more happy life.
And perhaps most importantly, multiplicity, the world needs us.
Thank you.
In 1900, a woman named Audience took it to a psychiatrist in France.
Audience would deliver and couldn't even remember the most basic details of his life.
His doctor was called Alas.
Alex didn't know how to help Australia, but he was flying by her until unfortunately, he passed in 1960.
After his death, Alice did an autopsy and found strange and open plates in the Australia brain, a guy who had never seen before.
The most amazing thing.
If I would have been living today, we couldn't give her more help than Alishness gave him 145 years ago.
Alaska was Dr. Alaska Alexander.
And Audience Detect, the first patient to get a diagnosis that we now call Alzheimer's disease.
Since 1901, medicine has advanced a lot.
antibiotics have been discovered and vaccines to protect us from infection, many treatments for cancer, anti-screens for heart and much more.
But it has been progress in the treatment of Alzheimer's treatment.
I'm part of a team of scientists who work to find a cure for Alzheimer's and over a decade.
So I think of this all the time.
Alzheimer's now affects 40 million worldwide.
But in 2050, it will affect 150 million people, by the way, including many of you.
If you expect to live until the age of 85 or more, the possibility of Alich will be almost one of each two.
In other words, there is the probability that they spend their dropping years with Alzheimer's or helping take care of a friend or be loved with Alzheimer's war.
Already in America, the care of Alzheimer's costs 200 billion dollars every year.
One of five dollars of medical assistance is spent in Alzheimer's disease.
Today is the most expensive disease, and its costs are providing a five times in 2050, as it aging the generation of the boom.
They may surprise you, but Alzheimer's one of the biggest medical challenges of our generation.
But it's done relatively little to fight it.
Today, one of the top 10 causes of death from all over the world, Alzheimer's only is the only thing that you can't prevent or cure or even slow your development.
We understand less than Alzheimer's than other diseases because we've invested less time and money in the research of the same.
The U.S. government spends 10 times more every year in cancer research than in Alzheimer's disease, despite the fact that it costs us more Alzheimer's Alexanders, and causes a annual number of deaths like cancer.
The lack of resources is due to a more fundamental cause, the lack of consciousness.
Because this is what few people know, but everybody should have shown: Alzheimer's disease, and we can cure it.
For most of the last 1940 years, all of us, even scientists, confuse Alzheimer's agencies.
We think it will be silent in a normal and inevitable part of aging.
But you only have to look at a picture of a healthy brain in comparison with an Alzheimer's patient to see the actual physical damage caused by this disease.
In addition to discovering a severe loss of memory and mental skills, damage to the brain caused by Alzheimer's seriously reduced life expectancy, and it's always deadly.
Remember, Dr. Alzheimer's found plates and foreign operations in the Australia brain a century ago.
For almost a century, we didn't know much about this.
Today we know that they're made of protein molecules.
You can think of a protein molecule like a piece of paper that folds like an origami.
There are places in the paper that are paradise.
And when you fold well, these sticky dots end up inside the inside.
But sometimes things come wrong, and some sticky dots stay on the outside.
This makes protein molecules pain each other, forming groups that can form big plates and opens.
That's what we see in the patients brain with Alzheimer's brain.
We've spent the last 10 years at Cambridge University trying to understand how this dysfunction works.
There are a lot of steps, and the identification of what happens to block is complex, like designing a bomb.
Court a wire could do nothing.
Court others can make the bomb explode.
You have to find the right step that blocked it, and then create a drug that does it.
Until recently, mostly the wires have been reduced and waiting for the best.
But now there's a diverse group of people, doctors, biologists, genius, chemistry, physicists, engineers and mathematics.
And together, we've managed to identify a critical step in the process -- now it's testing a new kind of drugs that blocked specifically this step to stop disease.
I'll show you some of our last results.
No one outside our lab has seen it yet.
So let's look at some videos of what happened when we tested these drugs in worms.
These are the healthy worms and you can see that they move with normal.
These worms on the other hand, they have protein molecules that attach each other inside them, like in humans.
And you can see that they're clearly sick.
But by giving our new drugs to these worms at a early stage, then we see that they heal and live a normal life.
This is just a positive initial result, but research like this shows that Alzheimer's a disease we can understand and cure.
After 1941 years of wait, there's real hope of what can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years.
But in order to grow that hope, we need help.
It's not about scientists like me, it's about you.
We need to know that Alzheimer's a disease is a disease, and that if we try it, we can beat it.
In the case of other diseases, patients and their families have gotten more research and exercise pressure about governments, pharmaceutical industry, about scientists and legislators and legislators and legislatures and legislatures and legislatures and legislatures and legislatures and legislatures and legislatures and legislatures and legislatures and legislatures and legislatures and legislatures and legislatures and legislatures and legislatures and legislatures and legislatures and legislatures and legislatures and legislatures and legislatures and
That was essential to move into HIV treatment in the late 1980s.
Today we see that same unit to sell cancer.
But Alzheimer's patients often can't talk for themselves.
And their families, the hidden victims of their loved ones and night, are often too much disappeared to go out and advocate for change.
So, it really depends on you.
Alzheimer's not in most cases a genetic disease.
Everybody with a brain runs the risk.
Today, there are 40 million patients like Australia, who can't create the change they need for themselves.
They help talk for them, and they help demand a cure.
Thank you.
I published this article in the column of New York Times, in January of this year.
To fall in love with someone, do this.
The article is about a psychological study, designed to create romantic love in the lab, and my own experience by testing it myself one night last summer.
So the procedure is pretty simple: two strangers are supposed to make 36 more and more personal questions and then both look at the eyes without talking for four minutes.
Here's a couple of questions of example.
Number 12, if you could wake up tomorrow with a quality or skill, what would it be?
Number two: When was the last time you cried to another person?
And right?
As it advances, these are more and more personal.
Number 30, I really like -- Tell your partner what you love from him or she -- I know very honest this time, and I gave things that you wouldn't say to somebody who has ever known.
When I stumbled with this study a few years ago, a detail really called me the attention, the joke that two of the participants had been married six months later, and invited all of the lab to the ceremony.
So I was skeptical about this process of making romantic love, but of course I was also intrigued as well.
And when I had the time to test this study, with someone who knew not particularly very well, I didn't expect to love.
However, we got love, and  And I thought it was a good story, so I sent it to the column Long Modern a few months later.
That was published in January, and now it's also advertised, so I guess some of you probably ask yourself, do you follow together?
And the reason I think this is because they've done this question over and over again in the last seven months.
And from this question is just about what I want to talk about today.
But let's go back to the subject.
A week before the article was published, I was very nervous.
I'd been working on a romantic book in the last few years, so I had been involved to write about my experience in romantic love in my blog.
But a blog entrance can get to a few hundred views as a lot, and those were usually just from my Facebook friends and imagining that my article in the New York Times will probably reach a few thousand views.
And that makes a good burden of attention in a relatively new relationship.
But as he said, I had no idea.
The article was published on line a Friday night, and already the Saturday, this happened in the traffic of my blog.
And Sunday -- I've already called me the Tom Show and the Godge Monording America.
In a month, the article received more than eight million views, and I was, by saying something, little prepared for this kind of attention.
One thing is to foster trust writing with sense about own loving experiences, but another thing is to discover that the loving life of one has been international news --  and that people around the world are really interested in the state of your new relationship.
And when people were calling or writing, what they did every day for weeks, always, they asked the same question: still follow together?
In fact, when I was preparing this talk, I made a quick search on the mailbox of my email with the phrase, "You still follow together?
And several messages appeared immediately.
They were from students and journalists and strangers like this.
I was interested in radio and asked it.
Even I gave a talk, and a woman shout up to the stage, "Hey Mandela where is your nonviolent?
And I immediately became red.
I understand this is part of the deal.
If you write about your relationship in an international newspaper, you should expect people to feel comfortable asking about it.
But I wasn't prepared for the sending of the answer.
The 36 questions seemed to have brought up life.
In fact, the New York Times published a competitive article for San Valley, including the experiences of readers by testing the study in these different degrees of success.
So, my first impulse to all this attention was to be very respected with my own relationship.
I said not to every request that both of us would make a public appearance together.
I took up television interviews, and you take pictures of us out of us.
I think I was afraid to become the instant icons of the lunch process -- a range that I didn't feel at the absolute quality.
And I understand that people didn't want to know just if the study worked, they wanted to know if it really works, or whether it was able to produce enduring love, not just an adventure, but love, lower love.
But this was a question that I didn't feel able to answer.
My relationship had just a few months old, and I felt, especially that people asked the wrong question.
How do you know if we follow together or not, and then do it give you it?
If the answer was no, I would do the experience of making these 36 questions less interesting?
Dr. Arthur Around wrote first about these questions in this same study in 1997, and there, the goal of the research was not to produce romantic love.
Instead of that, I sought to foster interpersonal acceleration between college students, using what Around called the supportive personal openness, programming and recipe.
Sounds romantic sound, right?
But the study does work.
The participants felt more close after doing it. Several later studies were also using the Prison fastest protocol of Arab as a quick way to create trust and interaction between strangers.
They've used it between police members and community, and they've used it between people of opposite political technologies.
The original version of history, which I tried last summer, which combines personal questions with four minutes of visual contact, was quoted in this article but unfortunately never published.
A few months ago, I was giving a talk in a small university of liberal arts, and then a student came up to me and told me with the temperature: I tried the study and didn't work.
He seemed discovered by it.
And I said, "Do you mean that you fall in love with the person who did it?
Well, he made a pause, OK.
I think she just wants us to be friends.
And I said, "But became better friends?
Do you feel that you did better know about testing the studio.
The adventure.
So, it worked, I said.
However, I don't think that was the answer that he looked for.
In fact, I don't think it's the answer that none of you are looking for when it comes to love.
I stumbled on the study for the first time when I was 29 and was getting a really difficult separation.
I had had that relationship since I was 20, which was basically all my adult life, and he was my first real love, and I had no idea how or if I could live without it.
So I flew in science.
I looked at everything I could find about romantic love, and I expected that that could somehow vaccinate the heart.
I don't know if I realized this at the time, I thought I just did research for the book that I wrote, but in retrospect, it seems really obvious to it.
I thought that if I was terrified with the knowledge of romantic love, I would never have to feel as bad and just as I felt then.
And all this knowledge has been useful in a way or another.
I'm more patient with love. I'm more relaxed.
I have more confidence to demand what I'm looking for.
But I can also see me more clearly, and I can realize that what I'm looking for is sometimes more than I reasonably can demand me.
What I look for love is a guarantee -- not just being loved today and being loved tomorrow, but that I'm going to continue to be loved for the person I love.
It may be that this is the guarantee that people asked when they wanted to know if we were still together.
The story that the media told about 36 questions is that there may be a shortcut to love.
There may be a way to somehow mitigate some of the implicit risk, and this is a very appealing story, because love makes us feel beautifully, but it's also terrifying.
But I think when it's about love, we're very willing to accept the short version of history.
The version of the story you ask, still follow together?
And its content with a yes or not.
So more than a question, I would propose that we ask more difficult questions, questions like, "How do you decide who deserves your love and who isn't it?
How do you stay in love when things are complicated, and how do you know when cutting and distributed?
How do you live with uncertainty that inevitably leads a relationship, or even more, how do you live with your couple of couple?
I don't know necessarily the answers to these questions, but I think they're a good start to have a more reflective conversation about what it means to love someone.
So if you want the short version of the history of my relationship, it's this one, a year ago, and I applied a study designed to create romantic love, we fall in, we still follow together, and I'm very happy.
But in love is not the same thing to remain love.
Laughing is the easy part.
So at the end of my article wrote, love didn't happen.
We look at love because we take the choice to be.
And I made a little bit about reading it now, not because it's true, but because at the time, I hadn't considered everything that was supposed to be able to have that choice.
I don't consider how many times we would have both to make that decision, and how many times it will keep doing that choice without knowing before if he would always choose me or not.
I want you to be enough to have done and answer 36 questions, have chosen to love someone so generous and nice and fun and have expressed that choice in the largest newspaper in the United States.
But what I've done, instead, is to turn my relationship into the kind of myth that I don't really think about.
And what I'm looking for, and what maybe spend my life looking for is that that myth is true.
I want the happy end in the title of my paper, which is, by the way, the only part of the article that I actually didn't write.
But what I have in change is the opportunity to choose someone, and the hope that he will also love me, and it's terrifying but that's the deal with love.
Thank you.
I was raised by some little monologues in full mountains, and in a way, I got like a forest of the forest.
In New York City a while ago,  something that really affected me but more details later.
I'll start with when I was eight years old.
He took a wooden box, and he buried a dollar bill of a dollar, a pen and a fork in her somewhere in Colorado.
And I thought some strange humans or some aliens would find this box about 500 years later, and learn how our species exchange ideas, for example, how we eat the spaces.
I had no idea.
Anyway, it has a thank you because here I am, 30 years later, and I'm still doing boxes.
At a time I was in Hawaii -- I like to go from exchange and make surf and all those weird things -- and I was doing a colleague for my mother.
And I took a dictionary and I threw up all the pages and I made a kind of string cells at the Agnes Martin style -- I covered them from resin, and a bee was trapped up.
Well, my mother is afraid of bees and it's allergic to them, so I added more resistant in the canvas, thinking I could hide it.
Instead, the opposite happened: somehow it seemed to be a size, as if you were looking at the text with a magnifying one.
So what did I do? I built more boxes.
This time, I started adding electronic elements, frogs -- strange bottles that I was finding on the street, everything I could find, because I was looking for things all my life, trying to relate to them and tell stories about these objects.
So I started drawing around the objects, and I realized that God I can draw in space.
I can flow away, draw the same thing that you do around a tent on the crime scene.
And I took the objects and I created my own table of invented.
First, biologists.
I then did some strange insects and creatures.
It was very fun to draw on the waste layers.
And it was great, because I started riding exhibitions and those things, and I was making some money, to take my girlfriend to dinner, for example, going to Sicon.
It was great, man.
At some point I'm interested in the human form, natural size sculptures with human beings within the layers.
It was great, except for one thing: I died.
I didn't know what to do, because the answer was going to kill me.
And I went to bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried to use glass.
I started drawing on the glass sheets, similar to the drawing in a window, then in another window and another window, and I had all these windows together that formed a three-dimensional composition together.
And this really worked, and so I could stop using the resistance.
So I did this for years, and my work culture with something very large, that I call "Terrorism."
For the "Terrorism I was inspired by the grade of Hollywood Boston delight which is a painting at the Museum of Prose in Spain.
Do you know?
Well, it's a fantastic picture.
They say it's a little bit ahead of their time.
Well, the terrorist." I'll explain this piece.
It weighs 11,000 pounds.
Five meters long.
It has double face, so it's 10 meters of composition here.
It's a little bit weird.
Well, that's the source of blood.
On the left, it's Jesus and the landscapes.
There's a cave where all these creatures with animal heads travel between two worlds.
They go from the world of representation to this infrastructure of analog mesh where they hide.
This is where creatures with animal heads are headed to the face, ready to kill them in mass sharing in the ocean.
The ocean is comprised from thousands of elements.
This is one god tied into a closed.
Billy Graham is in the sea. The Horror -- the Please Please Plato Palah, the Redwood Bin Laden's shelter -- there are all kinds of weird things that you can find if you look very well in the ocean.
In all ways also a kind of a woman.
He's coming out of the ocean, and he writes oil in a hand while the other hand comes up with clouds.
Their hands are like balances and it looks like a microscope that keeps the Earth and the cosmos in balance.
So it's an aspect of the terrorist."
It's a little bit of a narrative.
That's the hand in which he writes up.
And then, when you go on the other side, you have a traffic, like a bird, and you spit clouds from this catch.
It also has a $100 tail, a snake standard that joins the theater."
Anyway, his tail is going to be fired by going on a volume.
I don't know why it happened.
Things that happen, you know.
His tail ends up in a collective cheese of central cards from 1986.
Have you seen them?
They were done in the 1980s, as if they were baseball cards of terrorists.
Very close to their time.  This brings me to my last project.
I'm in the middle of two projects, one is called the psychologists.
This is a six-year-old project to make 100 of these human beings.
Each one is an archive of our culture, through media and material being engineered, dictionary or magazine.
But each act acts as a kind of archive in ways of being human, and they travel in groups of 20, four or 12 at once.
They're like cells, they together, they divide themselves.
And you can walk between them. It's taking me years.
Each one is basically a microscope of microscope that weighs 1,300 pounds with a human trapped inside its inside.
This has a little cave on the chest.
That's the head -- it's the chest, you can get the input in.
I'm going to join you for the rest of the body, there's a waterfall that comes out of the chest, and it covers the penis or not, or whatever it has is a kind of a agricultural thing.
It's a quick speed of these works because I can't explain them for a long time.
We have layers, you can see.
This is a body party per half.
This has two head, and it's communicating between the two.
There are some pills that come out and enter the head of this strange statue here.
There is a little forest scene within the ethnic charity.
Can you see it?
Anyway, this talk is about these boxes, just like the boxes that we live in.
We're in a box, the solar system is a box.
This brings me to my last box.
It's a brick box. It's called Pinchan Worships.
Within this box there's a physicist -- a neuroscience, a painter, a music, a writer, a radio emission, a museum, a school, an editorial arm that spreads all the content we do in the world, and a garden.
We send the box and all the people inside each other as particles.
And I think that's the way to change the world.
When you redefined who is and the box you're living in.
And together we get to realize that we are all together in this, that this illusion that we're different, these concepts of countries, of the borders, of religion, doesn't work.
We're all very made of the same matter and in the same box.
And if we don't start exchanging those things with sweetness and genetically, we're all going to die very soon.
Thank you very much.
What do you do when you give your head?
They take an aspiration.
But so that this pill has an effect against pain, first goes through the stomach, the gut and other organs.
To take a pill is the most effective and information system so that any dirty drug effect in the body.
The disadvantage, however, is that when you put any drug out of it.
And this is a big problem, especially in patients with HIV.
When they take antiretroviral drugs, they serve to decrease the number of viruses in blood, and increase the code of Chicago cells.
But they are also known for their adverse side effects, mostly negative, because in the time they are trying to get to the blood stream, they diagnose, and worse even for the time they are trying to get to their destination, which is where it's more important, in the dependence of HIV.
These are regions of the body like lymph nodes -- the nervous system, the lungs, where the virus is infinite and it doesn't easily enter the blood surface of patients that are subjected to regular therapy with antiretroviral drugs.
However, after treatment, the virus can wake up and infect new blood cells.
This is the big problem of HIV treatment with the current drug treatment that is a treatment of life running by the oral side.
One day, I sat and I thought, "Could we make the treatment directly to the deployment of virus, without the risk of diagram of drugs?
As a scientific experience, the answer was in front of me, the lasers of course.
If you use it in antibiotic, for the care of wounds and surgery of diabetes, you can use for anything you can imagine, including the intellectual transportation of drugs.
In fact, we're already using laser pulses to open or refine extremely small holes, which open and close almost immediately the cells infected with HIV to introduce drugs.
And the best thing to ask, "How is that possible?
We send a little bit and powerful laser beam on the cellular membrane infected by HIV while these cells are embedded in a liquid that contains drugs.
The laser goes through the cell, whereas the cell absorbs the drug in a matter of microbes.
Before we even notice, the hole is immediately replicated immediately.
We're currently testing this technology in vitro or Peter plates, but the goal is to take this technology into the human body, apply to the human body.
"How is that possible? You can ask.
Well, the answer is: through a device of three heads.
With the first head, which is our laser, we will make an incentive in the site of infection.
The second head, which is a camera, is led to the site of infection.
Finally, the third head, an injection that distributes the drug, releases it directly in the site of infection, whereas the laser is used again to keep the cells open.
Well, this doesn't look like a lot of time.
But one day, if you succeed, this technology can lead to the total eradication of HIV in the body.
Yeah. A cure for HIV.
This is the dream of all HIV research -- in our case, a laser treatment.
Thank you.
In the last decade, I've studied non-state groups -- armed organizations like terrorists, insurgents or military.
I document what these groups do when they're not displaced.
My goal is to understand better to these generations of violence and study ways to encourage the transition of violent participation to nonviolent confidence.
I do field work, in the world of politics and in the library.
Understanding these groups is key to solve almost every conflict in course, because war has changed.
It used to be a speech between states.
Not anymore.
Now it's a conflict between states and non-governmental actors.
For example, from the 211 peace agreement between 1975 and 2011, 1960 were signed between a state and a non-governmental actor.
So we need to understand these groups, we should even engage them or defeat them in any process of successful conflict resolution.
But how do you do that?
We need to know what motivates these organizations.
We know very well the reasons why they fight, how they do, but nobody analyzes what they do when they don't fight.
The armed struggle and politicians are related to it.
Everything is part of the same organization.
We can't understand these groups, not much less to defeat them, without a global vision.
The armed groups of today are complex organizations.
For example, the Lebanon Lebanon, known for his violent cooling against Israel.
From its creation in the 1980s, Hemos has also established a political party -- a network of social services and a military device.
Similarly, the Palestinian Hamburg, known by his suicide attacks against Israel, also managed the Gaza France from 2007.
So these groups do more than just firing up.
They're multiple.
They set up a complex communication machinery, radio stations, TV stations, web websites and strategies in social networks.
And here you have ISAID magazine, printed in English and published to recruit it.
armed groups also invest in a complex record of funds without short, but through profitable businesses, for example, building companies.
These activities are key.
They allow these groups to increase their strength, increase their funds, to recruit better and build their brand.
Armored groups also do something else: they create stronger ties with their population investing in social services.
They build schools, they manage hospitals, they put professional training programs or we were microbes.
Hemostry offers all these services and more.
The armed groups are also trying to conquer the population to provide something that the state not brightened, security and protection.
The ascent of the Taliban in an Afghanistan torn by war or even the beginning of the IIAM rise can also understand the efforts of these groups to provide security.
Unfortunately, in these cases, security has an incredibly elevated price for the population.
But in general, providing social services means filling a vacuum, a gap left by the government, and allows these groups to strengthen and increase their power.
For example, the election victory of 2006 from Palestinian Hamas cannot be understood without recognizing the social work of the group.
It's a really complex scenario, even in the West, when we look at the armed groups, we just think of the violent side.
But that's not enough to understand the strengths of these groups, the strategy or the long-term vision.
These groups are horrified.
They grow because they fill gaps left by government, and they emerge like armed groups and political groups, they participate in violent struggle and give governance.
And the more complex and the more sophisticated these organizations are these organizations, the less we can catalog it as something contrary to a state.
How do we call a group like Hemosure?
So dominated a part of a territory, they manage all their functions, they pick up the trash, they manage the sewer system.
Is it a state? Is it a red group.
Or maybe it's something else, something new and different.
And what is ISAIDS?
The lines are destroyed.
We live in a world of states, with no state and hydrogen, and the more weak the states are, like in the Middle East, the more they intervene and fill that gap the non-governmental actors.
This is important for governments, because to counteract these groups will have to invest more in not military tools.
filling that governance vacuum has to be in the center of any sustainable approach.
This is very important to establish and control peace.
If we understand better groups, we will better understand what incentives to offer to foster the transition of violence to nonviolent violence.
In this new department between states and non-state actors, military power can win some battle, but it won't give us peace or stability.
To achieve these goals we need long-term investments to fill that safety vacuum to fill that governance vacuum that allowed these groups to thrive at a beginning.
Thank you.
I'm a failure as a woman and as a feminist female.
My opinions about gender equality are very very soldier, but I fear that accepting the female tag would be unfair for the feminist.
I'm a feminist but pretty bad.
And therefore I was fed as a bad feminist female.
Or, at least, I wrote an article and a book called "The Bad Feminist: and then in the interviews, people started calling me the Mexican Measure.
So what started as a personal joke to myself and a deliberate program, has become a bigger thing.
Let me give you a step back.
When I was young, especially in my youth, and at the age of 20 years, I had strange ideas about the feminist women, these furry women, angry with men and they hated sex. As if that was a bad thing.
Today, I see how women are treated around the world and anger, in particular, seems a perfectly reasonable response.
But at that time, I was worried about the tone that was using people to insist that it could be feminist to be.
Being labeled as a feminist was a accountability, a taboo and a nasty word.
I was labeled as a woman who doesn't follow the rules, which is too much, with high self-worth.
Nobody wants to be that rebel woman, until it realizes that it's actually that woman and can't imagine being another person.
Over time, as I was growing up, I started accepting that I am, in fact, feminist and also, proud to be.
For me, certain claims are remarkable: women are equal to men.
We deserve the same side for the same work.
We have right to travel around the world as we want, free of alcohol or violence.
We have right to use easy and accessible and affordable and reproductive services.
We have the right to decide about our bodies, without need of legislative control or documentary control.
We have the right to respect.
There's more.
When you talk about women's needs, you have to have our other identity.
We're not just women.
We are people with a different body, expression of gender, religion and sexuality condition, skills and much more.
We need to have these differences and how they affect us, the same way that we have in common.
Without this kind of inclusion our feminist is nothing.
For me, these truths are evidence, but to be clear, I'm a disaster.
I'm full of contractions.
There's a lot of things that make me a bad feminist for me.
I have another conference.
When I drive the work, I listen to rap music beating all volume.
Although the letter degraded to women and offering me deeply the classic Salama Shakespeare of the Young Yana Twitter is incredible.
"Make it true with your mortality side.
Persist, danger, move until it hurts the container."
Think about it.
pure poetry, right?
I'm completely mortality for my musical taste.
I believe firmly at the work of man, which is all I don't want to do, including --  -- all the domestic tasks but also kill insects, the car collected and the condition of machinery.
I don't want to have anything to do with that.
The pink is my favorite color.
I enjoy fashion magazines and the nice things.
I can see "The Bacilic and the romantic comedy. And I have an amazing fantasy of the fairy stories that are made true.
Some of my credits are more described.
If a woman wants to adopt his husband, it's his choice, and I'm not who to judge it.
If a woman decides to stay at home to raise their children, I accept that choice, too.
The problem is not that it becomes economically vulnerable through this same choice, the problem is that our society is confined so that women are economically vulnerable when they choose to.
Let's solve this problem.
Remove the conventional feminist that has ignored or destiny historically the needs of the women of color, the workers, the homeless and transitional, to favor of white women, heterosexual and high class and high class and high.
Listen, if that's good feminist I'm a very bad feminist here.
The next thing happens: As a feminist I feel a lot of pressure.
We have this tendency to put feminist feedback into a pen.
We hope that they will take the perfection.
When they declare us, we will take them with a lot of taste from the same pen where we put them.
As I said, I'm a disaster -- I think of that pen before you try to put me there.
Too many women, particularly innovative and the leaders of the sector, are afraid of being labeled as feminists.
You're afraid to stand up and say, "Yes, I'm feminist: for fear of what that tag means, for fear not to be able to fulfill with the expensive expectations.
Let's take Ben for example, or as I call it, the God.
In the last few years it's a declined feminist female.
In the View Museum of 2014, at MIT, I acted in front of the word "Feyman of 3 feet tall.
It was a magnificent show, looking at this pop star absolutely embracing feminism and making women know and young men who will be feminist is something to be proud of.
Over time, cultural critics started clear debates if Berkeley was or not precisely feminist.
They rating their feminist instead of simply believing the word of an adult and mature woman.
We demand perfection of the feminist -- because we're still fighting for a lot, we want a lot, we need so much very carefully.
We go far beyond the sensual and constructive criticism to design the feminist of any woman, to destroy it until it has nothing left.
We don't need to do that.
The bad feminist or rather, a more inclusive feminist is the point of party.
But what happens next?
We went out of recognizing our implications to realize, going to action and being a little bit more valuable.
If I hear death music, I'm creating a demand for artists that would be more than happy providing an unlimited supply.
These artists will not change their way to talk about women in their songs until we demand change affecting their profit.
It certainly is hard.
Why does music have to be so pain?
It's hard to choose something better and so easy to justify a worst choice.
But when bad decisions are justify that makes it more difficult for women to achieve equality, the equality that we all deserve and is our responsibility.
I think of my niece, three and four years old.
It's two magnificent girls, decisions and brilliant, and also very brave. I want you to grow in a world.
Where they are being appreciated by the strong creatures that they are.
I think of them, all of a sudden, the best option is similar as something much easier to do.
We can all make better decisions.
We can change the channel when a television program is treating sexual violence against women as a sports -- it's going to be the Trash game.
We can change radio emission when we hear songs that treat women like nothing.
We can spend our money to go to the cinema elsewhere, when movies don't treat women as well as decorative objects.
We can stop supporting professional sports where athletes treat their partners as biomaterial shoes.
In any case, men especially white men, heterosexual men can say, "No, I'm not going to publish in your magazine, participate in your project, or work with you, until it doesn't include a number of enough women, so much to participate as to make decisions.
I'm not going to work with you until your publication or your organization is more inclusive with a wider range of people."
Those of us who are supposed but invited to participate in these kinds of projects, we can also deny us to be included until more like us are welcome to overcome the barriers to the decision position.
Because we're not a few people -- no performances -- without adopting these positions. Our achievements are going to mean very little.
We can make these little acts of bravery and hope that our decisions get to the top, people in the director of directors and movie producers and music producers and music, CEOs, the legislators that can make great decisions, more courageous, to create a lasting and meaningful change.
We can also claim our feminist and good, good, or any standing.
The last line of my book "Mary Feminist: says, "I would rather be a bad feminist to not be at all.
This is true because of a lot of reasons, but I say, especially because my voice was stolen and the feminist helped me get it.
There was an incident.
I call it incident to deal with what happened.
A couple of kids double me when I was very young, and I didn't know that kids can do this to a girl.
They treated me as nothing.
I started to believe that was nothing.
I stole my voice, and after all I don't dare to believe that I could say something that could matter.
But I was writing.
And I went back to me.
It reminds me in a stronger version of myself.
I read the words of those women who could understand a story like mine, and of the women who looked like me and understood what meant to live in this world if you have the brown skin.
I read the words of women who showed me that it was nothing.
I learned to write like them, and then I learned how to write like myself.
I found my voice again, and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond what you can measure.
Through writing and feminist, I also discovered that if I was a little bad, another woman could hear and see me and realize that none of us is the nothing that the world is trying to tell us that we are.
In a hand, I have the power to achieve anything.
And in the other, I hold the humble reality that I'm just a woman.
I'm a bad feminist -- I'm a good woman, I'm trying to improve my way to think, what I say and what I do, without leaving everything that makes me human.
I hope we can all do the same.
I hope that we can all be a little bit brave -- when you need to have such a value.
Right after Christmas last year, 132 children in California had speaked to have visited Devil or to be exposed to someone who had been there.
The virus then comes through the border with Canada, infecting over 100 children in Queen.
One of the tragic things of this outbreak is that the measles that can be fatal for a child with an individual immune system, is one of the most easily preventable diseases in the world.
There is an effective vaccine against this for more than a half a century -- but many of the children involved in the British outbreak hadn't been vaccinated because their parents were afraid of something ever worse, autism.
But a moment, was it not the article that caused the policy about autism and destroying vaccines, discovered and marked by being a fraud for the British Medical Joseph?
Does it not believe most intelligent scientists that the theory that vaccines cause autism is a stupid?
I think most of you know, but millions of parents around the world are still afraid that vaccines are going to be endangered to their children to have autism.
Why?
Here's why.
This is a graph of the rise of autism in time.
For most of the 20th century, autism was considered a very rare disease.
The few psychologists and pediatrician who had heard about it created all their professional life without seeing one case.
For decades, prevalence estimates were just three or four children per 10,000 children per 10,000 children.
But then, in the '90s, numbers started shooting up.
Force organizations like autism Australians are routinely referred to autism as an epidemic, as if I could tell another child in Devil.
What's going on?
If you're not the vaccines, what is it?
If you ask people in the Stanford Disease Control Center what's going on, they tend to based on phrases as a bit of a diagnostic diagnostic crisis: and a better detection of cases to explain these growing numbers.
But that kind of language doesn't diffuse a lot of the fears of a young mother looking for the face of his two year-old son, the visual contact.
If diagnostic criteria had to expand them, why were they so reduced at the beginning?
Why were the cases of autism so hard to find before the 1930s.
Five years ago, I decided to discover the answers to these questions.
I learned that what happened has less than to do with slow and causal progress of science than with the heart power of storytelling.
For most of the 20th century, doctors told a story about what the autism is and how they discovered, but that story turned out to be fake, and the consequences of the same are having a devastating impact in global public health.
There was a second more accurate story of autism that had lost and forgotten in the dark corners of the clinical literature.
This second story tells us everything about how we get here and where we have to go.
The first story starts with a child psychiatrist -- Leo Kanzi, from Johns Hopkins Houston, in 1947, Kanzi published an article that describes 11 young patients who seemed to be able to inhabit private worlds, not even their own parents.
They could fun for hours by waving hands in their faces, but they were prisoners of the panic as when they didn't put their favorite toy in their usual place without knowing it.
Over the base of the patients treated in their clinic, Kansary speculated that autism is very rare.
In the 1950s, as a major authority of the world in the subject, I declared that he had seen less than 150 true cases of his syndrome as he collected references of places as far as South Africa.
This is actually not surprising, because the Kantaria criteria for autism diagnosis were very restaurant.
For example, I needed to give that diagnosis to children with conversations, but now we know that epilepsy is very common in autism.
Once he was rating that he had turned nine out of 10 children sent by other doctors to her comfort for being autistic without giving them an autism.
Kanzi was an intelligent man, but part of his theories were not accurate.
It classify autism as a form of child psychologists caused by cold and career parents.
These kids, he said, have been carefully maintained in a refrigerator.
At the same time, though, Kanzi noticed that some of his young patients had special skills that were supporting in certain areas like music, mathematics and memory.
One of the children in their clinic could distinguish between 18 symphony before it was two years.
When his mother put one of his favorite records and he correctly said, "Generator."
But Kanzi had a bad opinion of these skills, by adding things like the children were just recording what they had heard to their personal parents, desperate to win their approval.
As a result, autism became a source of shame for families, and two generations of autistic children were sent to institutions for their own good, becoming invisible to the world in general.
Amazingly, it wasn't until the 1970s, that researchers started testing the theory of Kanzi that autism was weird.
Lord Window, cognitive psychologist of London, thought that the theory of the New mothers in Kanzi was quite stupid.
She and her husband John was warm and affectionate people, and they had a deep autistic daughter called Subject.
Lord and John knew how hard it was to raise a girl like Susi without support services, without special education, and without access to other resources without a diagnosis.
To defend the National Health Service, they needed more resources for autistic children and their families, Lorden and his colleague Judith Google decided to do something that should have done 30 years before.
They did a research study in the general population.
They put a suburb from London called Christmas to try to find the autistic children in the community.
What you saw was that the Kant model was too limited, because the reality of autism was much more colorful and diverse.
Some children couldn't talk at all, whereas others were fascinated in their fascination by the astrology, in the dinosaurs or the reality of the reality.
Otherwise, these kids didn't fit up in nice and students as he said Judais, and they saw a lot of them, much more than the Manhattan model of Kanzi would have predicted.
At first, they were lost by trying to make sense of their data.
How did no one have ever heard of these children before?
But then Luria found a reference to an article published in German in 1944, the next year to the Kant article -- and then I forgot -- buried under the ashes of a terrible time that nobody wanted to remember.
Kanzi knew about this competition article -- but it avoided straight to mention it in his own work.
There was not even a translation to English, but luckily, the husband of Lord spoke German, and he translated it for her.
The document offers an alternative story of autism.
His author was a man named Hans Asperger, who led an integrated clinic with an inner school in Vienna, in the 1930s.
The ideas of Asperger's ideas for children with learning differences were even progress for contemporary standards.
The morning in their clinic started with music classes with music, and children followed their games on Sunday afternoon.
Instead of blaming the parents of causing autism, Asperger described as a political disability of life that requires compassionate forms of support and spaces adapted during the course of all life.
Instead of treating children in their clinic as patients as patients, Asperian called them their little teachers, and it was dedicated to help the development of methods of education that were particularly suitable for them.
Finally, Asperger saw autism as a diverse continuum that was carrying a surprising variety of donations and disability.
He believed that autism and autistic traits were common and always have been, seeing aspects of this continuum in archives known in the pop culture as the awkward social scientist and the desperate professor.
He was beyond even to say, that for success in science and art, a fish of autism is essential.
Lord and Judais found that Kanzi was wrong in which autism was infected, so the parents were the cause.
In the next few years, they worked on silence with the American Association of psychiatry to expand the criteria of the diagnosis that would reflect the diversity of what they called automatic spectrum."
By the end of the '80s and early '90s, their changes went into video, by holding the limited model of Kanzi by a broad and even Asperger's model.
These changes didn't fit on broken shoe.
Interestingly, when Lorden and Judith worked between bases to reform these criteria -- people around the world see an autistic adult for the first time.
Before he came out River Man in 1988, just a little circle, served by experts knew what autism, but after the including act of Dusty Houston as Ramber Babylon as Ramber Babylon and the recognition of "Ray Man with four prizes from Academy -- papers, psychologists, teachers and fathers around the world knew what the autism.
At the same time, the first easy clinical trials were introduced to be used to diagnose autism.
I should no longer have a connection with that little circle of experts to make a diagnosis for his son.
The combination of "Ray Man: The changes in the criteria and the introduction of these tests created an effect of network, a perfect storm of autism awareness.
The number of diagnoses began to get up, just like Lubetrage and Judais, actually hoped that the people with autism, and their families finally got the support and the services that were deserve.
And so Andrew Washington came to blame vaccines for increases in the diagnosis. A simple, powerful, strong history and very bad history as the theory of Kanzi that autism was infected.
If the current estimate of prevention center that one in six children in America are in the spectrum -- it's right, autism is one of the largest minority groups in the world.
In the last few years, autistic people have joined on the Internet to reject the idea that they are the puzzles for solving by new medical advances by taking the term neurons to celebrate the variation of human cognition.
One way of understanding neuroscience is to think of terms of human operating systems.
The fact that a PC doesn't work with Windows doesn't mean it's broken.
According to autistic standards, the normal human brain is easily different, obeside social, and suffer from an attention deficit to detail.
The autistic people have difficulty to live in a world not built for them.
70 years later, we're still reaching Asperger, who believed that the cure for the most uncomfortable aspects of autism are in the understanding of teachers, employers with capacity, companies of support, and parents with faith in the potential of their children.
An autistic woman named Zosovel Zassis once said, "We need all the hands in covered to learn the boat of humanity.
While we navigate an uncertain future, we need all forms of human intelligence on the planet to address the challenges we face as a society.
We can't afford to waste a brain.
Thank you.
