You know what I do is to write for kids, and, in fact, I'm probably the author for kids, you have more read in the U.S.
And I always tell people I don't want to seem like a scientist.
I can <unk> like farmer, or with leather clothes, and nobody has chosen a farmer.
I'm here today to talk to you about circles and <unk>
And you know that an epiphany usually is something that you had in some place.
You just have to turn to the apple to see it as a <unk>
That's the painting of a circle.
A friend of mine did that -- Richard <unk>
It's the kind of complicated circle that I'm going to talk about.
My circle began in the middle school in the middle school, in <unk> Ohio where I was the rare of the class.
When I went to milk every week in the bathroom of the children, until a teacher saved my life.
She saved my life by letting me go into the bathroom of the teachers.
I was doing it in secret.
For three years, for three years.
And I had to go from the city.
He had a thumb, and 85 dollars, and I ended up in San Francisco, California -- I found a lover -- and in the <unk> I felt the need to start working on organizations that fight AIDS.
About three or four years ago, half the night I got a phone call, the <unk> lady who said, "I need to see you.
I'm <unk> that adults never get to know us.
You could invite you to Ohio and please bring that man that I know you have found.
And I have to tell you that I have <unk> pancreatic cancer, and I'd like you to talk to you with this please."
Well, the next day we were in <unk>
We went to see, we were <unk> <unk> and we realized that she needed to be <unk>
We found a place, the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> of their family, because it was necessary,
It's something we knew how to do.
And so the woman that I wanted to <unk> as an adult came to <unk> became a box of cinders -- and it was put in my hands.
And what happened was that the circle had closed it in a circle -- and that epiphany that I told you about it became present on itself.
<unk> is that death is part of life.
She saved my life, my partner and I save the one of it.
And you know that that part of life needs everything that the rest of life.
It needs truth and beauty, and I'm very happy that today I talked a lot about this.
It also needs -- it needs dignity, love and pleasure. And it's our job to provide those things.
Thank you.
As an artist, as an artist, the connection is very important to me.
Through my work, I'm trying to express that humans are not separated from nature, and that everything is interconnected.
I was for the first time to Antarctica almost 10 years ago, and I saw my first <unk>
I was <unk>
My heart can fast, I was <unk> trying to understand what was in front of me.
I put them around <unk> of the water almost 60 feet, and I couldn't even think that it was a <unk> about another <unk> of snow after year.
<unk> are born when they fall out of the glaciers or break the walls of ice.
Each iceberg has their own individual personality.
They have a different way of interacting with their environment and their experiences.
Some people refuse to hold and hang on to the end, whereas others can't get it more and <unk> in a <unk> passion <unk>
It's easy to think, when you look at a <unk> that are isolated apart and themselves, largely as we look at ourselves as a human.
But the reality is the opposite.
As a <unk> melts a <unk> I'm breathing its atmosphere <unk>
As a iceberg melts an iceberg releases freshwater in minerals that feeds in many forms of life.
I come to photograph these <unk> as if it was about the portraits of my ancestors, knowing that in these unique moments there are such a way and won't exist in that way again.
It's not the death when it's <unk> it's not an end, but a continuation of its way through the cycle of life.
Part of the ice of the <unk> I photograph is very <unk> it has a couple of thousands of years.
And another part of the ice has over 100,000 years.
The last pictures I'd like to show you are from a iceberg that I photographed in <unk> Greenland.
It's a little frequent to actually witness a <unk> <unk>
Here it is.
You can see the left one little boat.
It's about five meters.
And I'd like you to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and your line of <unk>
You can see here, starting to <unk> the ship has moved to the other side, and the man is standing there.
This is a <unk> iceberg <unk>
<unk> of the water about 120 feet or 40 feet.
This video is in real time.
And so <unk> the iceberg shows a different side of his personality.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine two couples in 1979, the same day, exactly at the same time, every single <unk> a baby.
So, two couples every one with a baby.
I don't want you to get too close to the details of conception, because if you stop to think about the conception of it, I'm not going to pay attention.
Let's think about that for a moment.
And on this stage, I want you to imagine that, in one case, the chromosome and sperm joins the X chromosome in the <unk>
And in the other case, the <unk> chromosome joins the X chromosome in the <unk>
Both of them <unk> and you start life.
We'll go back to talk about them later.
In my activity in my ground in the ground on the ground.
In one of my <unk> work with the story of anatomy.
I am <unk> by training, and what I study in this case is the way people allocate the anatomy -- that is, of human bodies and <unk> how they've considered body fluids.
The other role that performance works is an activist, as a <unk> of patients or, as I say sometimes, <unk> <unk> people who are medical patients.
In this case, I've been working with people whose physical characteristics defy social norms.
I've been working on, for example, with fraternal twins two people inside a body.
I've worked with people with <unk> people much lower than the average.
And I've been working with a lot of cases of people with sex <unk> individuals whose physical limbs do not fit into male and conventional female <unk>
In general, we can <unk> <unk>
<unk> embraces many ways.
I'm going to give you some examples of ways of having a sex that doesn't have a sex in the ordinary and female ways.
For example, the case is the case of the individual <unk> <unk> which is called the chromosome <unk> and it tells the <unk> that we all have in the <unk> life that we get <unk>
And then, in the life of life, the testicles are producing testosterone.
But because this individual has no receptors in testosterone, the body doesn't react to the same.
It's <unk> <unk>
So, there's high testosterone levels but <unk>
As a consequence, the body develops in a general course in a single course of the body.
When you <unk> the baby is going to look like a child.
It's a child. It's raised as a child.
And often, it's not yet until puberty, when it's growing and developing the breast but it doesn't have the menstrual period, when someone realizes something is happening.
And then they realize that instead of having <unk> and <unk> it actually has <unk> and a chromosome and <unk>
The important thing to understand is that you can think it's a man, but it's actually not like this.
Women, like men, we have in the body -- something called areolar <unk>
They're in the back of the body.
<unk> glands produce <unk> the hormone hormone.
Most women like me -- I consider -- I consider a <unk> woman, not know his structure -- I think it's a typical woman most of women like me are sensitive to the <unk>
We produce <unk> and we respond to the <unk>
As a consequence, someone like me has the most exposed brain to <unk> that the woman who was born with <unk> which has <unk> <unk>
So sex is something complicated. It's not that <unk> are in the middle of the <unk> in some way they can be everywhere.
Another example: a few years ago I got a call from a 19 year-old boy born and raised as <unk> had girlfriend, and sexual relationships with her, he had a life as a boy and just found out he had <unk> and <unk>
He had an extreme way of a disease known as <unk> <unk> <unk>
He had 20th 20th chromosomes and in the uterus -- the <unk> glands were so active that, in essence, created a male hormone environment.
As a consequence, their genitalia were <unk> their brain was exposed to the hormone component, typically male.
He was born with <unk> nobody <unk> nothing.
And it was at the age of 19, when he started having criminal problems caused by the internal <unk> when doctors found that, in fact, was a woman in it.
Well, another quick example of a case of <unk>
Some people with historical chromosomes develop what is known as <unk> is to say, they have <unk> tissue wrapped in <unk> tissue.
We don't know how well that happens.
So, there are lots of sex.
The reason that kids with this kind of bodies are going to be <unk> twins, or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- it's not so much to be able to have a better physical health.
In many cases people are perfectly healthy.
And the reason that you get into a lot of surgeries is that they're a threat to our social categories.
The system is based usually in the idea that a particular anatomy brings up a particular identity.
We have the idea that being a woman is to have operational identity, <unk> being black wants to say to have African anatomy in historical terms.
Very simplistic idea.
And when you present a body that shows something quite different, we have problems with <unk>
So we have very <unk> ideas in our culture about <unk>
Our nation is based on a very romantic concept of <unk>
Imagine how amazing it is to have children that are born like two people in a body.
The most height case is the most height of the year with the South African <unk> <unk> <unk> was placed in judgment of his sex in the <unk> <unk>
A lot of journalists called them to ask, "What do you do the test are going to do to determine if <unk> <unk> is man or <unk>
And I had to explain to you to the reporters that exist such a test.
In fact, we now know that sex is so complicated that we have to admit that nature doesn't draw a <unk> line between men and women or <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> are us who we draw that line.
So what we have is a situation where the more you get the science, more we have to admit that these categories were going on, and we were able to admit that these categories -- stable categories that are attached directly to <unk> <unk> are much more <unk> than they were <unk>
And not just in terms of sex.
It's also in terms of race, something that turns out much more complicated than the terminology <unk>
As we see, we get into a <unk> terrain.
<unk> for example, the fact that we share at least 95 percent of the DNA with chimpanzees.
What do you find?
And as we put in science we get more and more in a awkward area where we have to recognize that the <unk> categories that are probably too <unk>
And we're looking at this in all walks of human life.
One of them, for example, in our current culture, in the United States today, are the struggles to the beginning and in the end of life.
It's hard to set up a moment from which a body becomes human and has different rights to the <unk>
There are very <unk> discussions today <unk> not in public, but I know within the <unk> about when someone considers dead.
Our ancestors had never had to get to this question of whether someone was dead.
As a lot of him would put a pen in front of the nose, and if he was still not <unk>
If you stopped moving it up.
But today, we can, for example, extract vital organs of a body and put them on another body.
And as a result, we have to deal with the dilemma of really figuring out, and this brings us into a hard situation where we don't have the simple categories of the past.
And you might think that this explosion of categories might be happy to someone like me.
In politics I'm progressive, <unk> people with unusual bodies, but I have to admit that it makes me nervous.
So what these categories are much more fragile than we thought we were thinking about.
It was <unk> from the concept of democracy.
And to tell you about this tension first, I have to admit that I'm a fervent fan of my Parents <unk>
I know they were <unk> I know they were <unk> but they were big.
I mean, they were as brave and audacious and <unk> and so radical in what they did, that I find each of you looking at that musical <unk> <unk> and not by music, which is totally <unk>
It's because of what happened in <unk> with Parents <unk>
Parents would be <unk> to me, the first activists of the anatomy and explain why.
What they did, it was a <unk> concept, and it <unk> it with another that it was radical and beautiful and stayed for 200 years.
And as you all remember what <unk> our parents <unk> was the idea of the <unk> The monarchy was based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy.
The old world of the world didn't know the DNA, but they had clear the idea of the right of birth.
They had the concept of blue blood.
They were from the idea that the political power was coming up with the right of the blood of blood passed from the grandfather to the father and then the son, etc.
Parents was rejected by rejected that idea and replace it for a new concept of <unk> and that concept was that all men are created equal.
They set up the game field and decided that the anatomy that mattered was the anatomy in common and not <unk> differences, that was very radical.
And in part they were doing it because they were part of a <unk> system where two things were <unk>
It was <unk> democracy and at the same time <unk> the science.
And there's very clear, if you look at the story of the Parents -- that many people were very interested in science and the idea of a <unk> world.
They were <unk> from the Afghan explanations and therefore <unk> the concept of being able to be passed through a <unk> idea of birth.
They were moving into a <unk> concept.
And if you look, for example, the Declaration of <unk> they talk about nature and the god of nature.
They don't talk about God and the nature of God.
They talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are.
And as a result, they were passing the idea of <unk> <unk>
And in doing so, they were <unk> the foundations of the future rights movement <unk>
They didn't think of it, but they did it for us and it was great.
And what happened next?
And women are <unk>
Then came the success of the Civil Rights movement with people from the <unk> <unk> who said, "I'm not a <unk>
We found men in the rows of the Civil Rights movement saying, "I'm a man."
So again, people who are <unk> to <unk> <unk> about <unk> difference and, again, <unk>
We see the same with the movement of <unk>
The problem is, of course, as we look at the <unk> we have to start asking why we keep in certain <unk>
But attention, I want to keep some <unk> <unk> in our culture.
For example: I don't want to give a fish the same rights than a human.
I don't want to say that we should be <unk> to anatomy.
I don't want to say that the five years was supposed to allow sex or get married.
There are some <unk> <unk> that for me have sense and I think we should be <unk>
But the challenge is trying to figure out what they are, why they keep them and make sense.
Well, let's go back to those two beings at the beginning of this talk.
We have two <unk> both <unk> in <unk> exactly the same day.
Imagine that one of them, "I love it was born three months before time: June 1 1980.
Henry, the other thing was born in that, was born March 1 1, 1980.
For the fact that we were born three months before Mary is attributed to all of the rights three months before Henry -- the right to sexual consent, the right to vote, the right to <unk>
Henry has to wait for all of that not because it has a different biological age, but because it was born.
We found other <unk> in relation to their rights.
So Henry, to virtue of being considered -- if I haven't told you whether it's <unk> in virtue of being considered a man now is <unk> from the lone <unk> that Mary doesn't have to worry about.
Mary, for its part, does not have the same rights to marriage that Henry in all states, for example.
Henry can marry all states with a woman, but Mary can marry a woman only in some states.
So we still have <unk> categories that in many aspects are <unk> and questionable.
And now the question is, what do we do now that science moved both in the field of the anatomy that we get to the point of having to admit that a democracy based on the anatomy that could be <unk>
I don't want to give up the science, but at the same time sometimes I feel like science <unk>
Where are we <unk>
It seems that what happens in our culture is a kind of <unk> attitude -- "Well, we have to draw the line in some part, so we're going to do."
But a lot of people are stuck in a strange position.
For example, Texas at some point has decided that to marry a man you don't have to have chromosome and to marry a woman you have to have <unk>
Now, in practice they don't make a test test for people.
But this is also very strange given the story that I told you about the principle of <unk> <unk>
If we look at one of the founders of modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King, in his speech, <unk> <unk> offers a solution.
It says that we should judge people in the color of their skin, but on the content of their <unk> going beyond anatomy.
And I want to say, "Yes, the idea looks pretty good.
But in practice, how do you do this?
How do you judge people at the basis of their <unk>
I want to point out also that I'm not sure that we should be able to focus on this for human rights to people, because I've been saying that I know from some <unk> <unk> who probably deserve more social services than some of the humans I know.
I also want to say that maybe some <unk> that I know can be able to make more intelligent decisions and <unk> about their sexual relationships than people from 40 I know.
So how do we put the subject of the content of <unk>
It turns out very hard.
And a part of me wonder what would happen if the character of a person could be measured by the future being measured with an instrument, maybe with an MRI.
We want to really get to that point?
I'm not sure where we go.
What I know is that it seems to be very important that the United States is going to keep driving this current current way to the issue of democracy.
We've done a good job in defense of democracy and I think we'll do a good job in the future.
We don't live, for example, in a context like the Iranian in which a man who feels attracted to other men is susceptible to being <unk> unless you're willing to have sex change in which case it is allowed to live.
We're not in that situation.
I'm glad to say that we don't have a context like a surgeon who talked about a couple of years ago that he had done to give birth twin twins and then pick them off and then they <unk> their fame.
But when the phone asked her one of the operation was a very <unk> operation, he said that in that other country these children would be very <unk> and therefore I had to do it.
I said, "Well, it's considered the political asylum instead of <unk> <unk>
America provides huge possibilities for people to be the ones who are not <unk> to change the way in the state.
So I think we need to be your head.
Well, to finish -- I mean I've been talking a lot about the <unk>
And I want to think about how democracy would be democracy, or as it might have been, if we had given more participation to the <unk>
And I want to say something a little radical for a feminist, and it's that I think there might be different ideas from different <unk> <unk> in particular if there are people thinking about a group.
From years ago, since I have been interested in the <unk> I've been interested in the <unk>
And one of the things that has been interested in are the differences between men and women in terms of thinking and operating in the world.
And what we know about studies of studies -- is that women, on average, not all, but in <unk> they tend to pay more attention to complex social relationships and to care about those who are <unk> within the group.
And if we think about that, we have an interesting situation in our hands.
And years ago, when I was in graduate school, one of my advisers who knew I was interested in feminism <unk> I considered <unk> as <unk> made me a <unk>
<unk> what has the <unk>
And I thought, "It's the stupidest question I've ever heard.
Feminism has to be able to get rid of the stereotypes of gender, so there's no female in the <unk>
But the more I have thought about his question, the more I've got to have something of female in the <unk>
I mean, there might be something, on average, something between the female and the male that makes us more <unk> to complex social relationships and willing to help the most vulnerable.
So if I fathers myself, they were very aware to find the way to protect people in a part of the state, it's possible that, to have gotten more <unk> to this concept, maybe we would have enriched the concept of protection with <unk> support.
And maybe that's what we need to do in the future when we look at democracy beyond <unk> to think less in the individual body, in terms of identity and thinking more about relationships.
So while we try to create a more perfect <unk> let's think about what we do for each other.
Thank you.
In 2007, I decided we had to rethink how we think about economic development.
Our new goal should be that when every family thinks where you want to go to live and work, have the possibility of choice between at least a handful of different cities that are competing for attracting new residents.
Well, at this moment we're far from that goal.
There are thousands of millions of people in developing countries that don't have a single city willing to <unk>
But the amazing thing about cities is that it's worth a lot more than the cost of construction.
So we could easily <unk> the world -- maybe hundreds of new cities.
Well, this may sound absurd if you have never thought about new cities.
But they just put up by the buildings of apartments.
Imagine that half of those who wanted to live in apartments already as they were owners and then on the other half of them not to do it.
They could try to increase the ability to make <unk> in all existing buildings.
But you know that the problem that <unk> is that those buildings and the areas that surround them have rules to avoid the <unk> and the building distractions of construction.
So it would be very difficult to do all those <unk>
But you could go to a totally new place, build a whole new apartment building, always and when the standards of that place will be built instead of putting it away.
So I proposed that governments are going to take new reform zones to contain cities and gave them a name, cities under <unk>
I later found out that more or less at the same time, <unk> and <unk> were thinking about the challenge of reform Honduras.
Did you know that every year about 75,000 <unk> would come out of their country to go to the United States, and they wanted to ask, what could they do to make sure that those people could be able to stay and do those same things in Honduras.
In the summer of 2009, <unk> went through a constitutional crisis.
In the next American election, <unk> <unk> <unk> a platform with a platform in which they were <unk> reforms and at the same time.
He asked <unk> that was his head of <unk>
Meanwhile, I was preparing to give a talk on TEDGlobal.
Through a process of <unk> trial and error and a lot of trials with users, I tried to reduce this complicated concept of cities under <unk> to their most fundamental ideas.
The first point was the importance of the norms, like those rules that say they can't go and listen to all the current residents of apartments.
It takes a lot of attention to the new technologies, but it takes a lot of technologies for <unk> and usually they are the rules that keep us going forward.
In the fall of 2010, a friend of Guatemala was sent to <unk> a link to <unk>
He showed it to <unk>
They called me to me.
They said, <unk> this to the leaders of our <unk>
So in December we met in Miami, a conference room in a hotel.
I tried to explain to you about how valuable the cities are, much more valuable than their cost <unk>
And I used this image that shows the value of land in a place like New York City <unk> that in some cases, it's worth thousands of dollars per square meter.
But it was a pretty abstract argument and at some point, when there was a pause, he said, <unk> maybe we could see the video of the <unk> talk.
And the talk was describing very simple in terms that a city under <unk> is a place where you start with <unk> <unk> a <unk> that <unk> the rules that are going on, and a choice for people to choose if they want to go or not to live under those norms.
So the president of <unk> called me, and told me that we had to do this project, this is important, this might be the way that our country is going.
I was asked to be <unk> and I would talk about the four and five of January.
So I presented another talk full of data, which included an image like this, which was trying to explain that to make a lot of value to a city, this has to be very big.
This is a picture of <unk> and the white line is the new airport that built in <unk>
Only this airport is about 100 square miles.
So I was trying to convince the <unk> that to build a new city, you have to start with a place that is testing at least 1,000 square miles.
That's over 100,000 <unk>
Everyone <unk> <unk>
The faces of the public were very serious and <unk>
The leader of Congress approached the platform and said, "Professor <unk> thank you very much for his talk, but maybe we could see the video of the <unk> talk.
I have this in my <unk>
So I sat down and showed the <unk>
And this explained that a new city can offer new options for people.
There would be a choice of a city that might be going to be in <unk> instead of hundreds of miles away to the North.
And we also have new options for leaders.
Because the leaders of <unk> would need help from <unk> countries, they could benefit from the countries that would help them establish and make the rules of the <unk> so that everybody could trust that <unk> effectively <unk>
We went and we saw a site.
This picture is there.
It could be able to run a thousand square miles.
And shortly later, the 19 of January, voted in Congress to <unk> his Constitution and add a constitutional arrangement that would allow these special regions to be able to create these special regions.
In a country that was just going through this <unk> crisis in Congress in favor of this constitutional person was <unk> to one.
All the <unk> all the <unk> in society, the <unk>
For <unk> in the <unk> it has to pass twice in Congress.
On February 17 passed away again in another voting -- to <unk>
Immediately after the voting -- about 21 to 24 of February, a <unk> <unk> went to two places in the world that are more interested in participating in cities.
One of them is South Korea.
This is a picture of a new new center of the city that is building in Korea, is bigger than the center of Boston.
Everything that you see there was built in four years, after they spent four years out of the <unk>
The other country was interested in building building is Singapore.
In fact, they've been built two cities in China and they're preparing for a third.
And if you think about this anyway, this is the point where we are.
They have a website, and they're already thinking about a site for the second city.
They're preparing a legal system that would allow <unk> administrators and then would allow <unk> to operate under a external legal system.
A country has already committed to allow their Supreme Court to be the court of last for this new <unk> system.
There's <unk> and builders of cities that are very interested in the project.
They can even get some funding.
But the only thing we know you have already solved is that they have a good number of residents.
There are a lot of companies that wanted to be installed in <unk> especially in a place with an area of free trade, and there's a lot of people who would like to go to live there.
In the world, there are 700 million people who say they would like to change the other way.
There's a million a year that comes out of Latin America to go to the United States.
A lot of them are parents who have to leave behind their family to go get a job, sometimes they're mothers who have to win the money for just eating or buy clothes.
Sadly, sometimes there are even kids who are trying to meet their parents who haven't seen, in some cases, in a decade.
So what does it seem to think about building a new city in <unk>
Or build a dozen of these, or a hundred of these all over the world?
What does it seem to think about <unk> so that families can choose between various cities that are competing for attracting new <unk>
This is an idea worth spreading.
And my friends <unk> I was asked to say, "Thank you TED TED.
I'm a <unk> and this is my <unk>
But before I show you what's inside, I'm going to make a public confession -- and it's that I live obsessed with <unk>
I love to find herself and more recently, to photograph and publish in my blog suits and colorful and different for each time.
But I don't buy anything new.
All my clothes is the second hand of <unk> markets and <unk>
Ah, thank you.
The second hand stores allow me to reduce the impact of my <unk> in the environment and my <unk>
I go to meet people -- usually my money goes to a good <unk> My aspect is <unk> and buy it into my personal search for <unk>
I mean, what am I going to find today?
It's going to be my size?
I would like <unk>
It will cost less than 20 dollars?
If all the answers are positive, then I feel that I've won.
Going back to the subject of my <unk> I want to tell you what I was going to do for this exciting week at TED.
I mean, what do you bring to with someone who has all that <unk>
So I'm going to show you exactly what suit.
I've brought seven pairs of clothing and nothing else.
<unk> in exactly a week is all I've put in my <unk>
I imagined it would be able to find everything else that I'd like to use after I got here to Palm <unk>
And because I don't know that the woman who walks for TED in clothes,  -- that means I found some things.
And I'd like to show you now the sets for this week.
It doesn't sound interesting?
As I do, I'm also going to tell you some of the lessons of life that, believe it or not, I've learned in this adventure to not use new clothing.
Let's start with Sunday.
I call this <unk> <unk>
You don't have to spend a lot of money to look good.
You almost always see it for less than 50 dollars.
All together, including the <unk> it took me <unk> and it's the most expensive thing I've been used in the week.
<unk> the color is energy.
It's almost <unk> impossible to be <unk> when you're wearing a bright red <unk>
If you're happy, you're going to attract other people happy.
<unk> The integration is <unk>
I've spent a lot of time in life trying to be myself and at the same time.
Just yourself.
If you get rid of the right people, you don't just bother you <unk>
<unk> <unk> of the kid that you get in.
Sometimes people tell me that it seems to play the <unk> or I remember their little <unk>
I like to <unk> and say, <unk>
<unk> <unk> is the key.
If you think you see you well with something, it's almost safe you are.
And if you think you don't do well with something, it's probably true.
My mother taught me this day after day.
But it wasn't until the 30 years I really understood their meaning.
And I'm going to explain it in a few seconds.
If you think you're a beautiful person in your interior and outside, you don't see you can't <unk>
So there's no excuse for anyone in this audience.
We need to be able to achieve everything we want to do.
Thank you.
<unk> A universal truth to you: The gold <unk> go with everything.
And finally, <unk> <unk> a <unk> personal style is a great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word.
I've tested it again and again when people approached me this week just because of what I was using. And we had fantastic conversations.
Obviously this is not going to go into my little <unk>
So before I went home, Brooklyn, I will donate everything.
Because the lesson that I'm trying to learn this week, is that you have to leave back certain things.
I don't need to make it emotionally emotionally to these things, because around the corner, there will always be another <unk> <unk> <unk> and bright <unk> if there's a little bit of love in my heart and I go on.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is a representation of your brain that we can divide into two parts.
The left side, which is the logic and the right side, which is the intuitive.
So if you take a scale to measure the <unk> of each <unk> we could design a blueprint for our brain.
For example, this would be somebody who is completely logical.
This would be somebody who is totally intuitive.
So where does your brain look like?
Some <unk> for one of these ends, but I think for most of the members of this audience, your brain is something like this -- with a big <unk> in both <unk> at the same time.
It's not that they're mutually <unk>
You can be logical and intuitive.
I consider myself one of those people, who just like most other quantum physicists -- we need a lot of logic for <unk> these complicated ideas.
But at the same time, we need quite intuition to make experiments really work.
How do we develop this <unk> Well, we like to play with things.
We get to play with them and then we see as <unk> and then we developed our intuition from that point.
And actually, you do the same thing.
So the intuition that you can have developed over the years is the one that says that one thing can be only in a place at the time.
I mean, it might sound weird to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time, but you weren't born with this <unk> <unk>
I remember looking at a child playing in a parking bar.
It was a little boy, and he didn't do it very well, it always <unk>
But I bet you play with that parking bar with that parking spaces, taught him a very valuable lesson, and it is that the big things don't allow the <unk> and stay in a place.
This is a great conceptual model that you can have in the world, except you're a particle physicist.
It would be a terrible model for a particle physicist, because they don't play with a car bars play with these strange little particles.
And when they play with their particles, they discover that they do all kinds of weird things -- as they can go through walls, or they can be in two different places at the same time.
And then they wrote all these observations, and they called it theory of quantum mechanics.
And at that point was the physics of a few years ago; you need quantum mechanics to describe those little particles.
But you don't need to describe the big objects that are around us every day.
I didn't fit it very well to my intuition, and maybe it's because I don't play very often with particles.
Well, sometimes I play with them, but not a lot.
And I've never seen them.
I mean, nobody saw a <unk>
But it didn't fit it well to my logic.
Because if it's all made of little particles and all the small particles follow the principles of quantum mechanics, then it shouldn't all follow the principles of quantum <unk>
I don't find the reason why it hasn't been.
And therefore I would feel much better if I could somehow demonstrate that a common object also follows the principles of quantum mechanics.
That's why a few years ago, I proposed to do exactly that.
And I did.
This is the first object you can see that has been in a <unk> of quantum mechanics.
What we see here is a little computer chip.
And you can try to see the green dot right in the middle.
That's the little metal piece I'm going to talk about in a minute.
This is a picture of the object.
And I'm going to zoom in a little bit. It's right at the center.
And then we do a good approach to the little <unk> of metal.
What we see is a little little bit of metal, with a springboard for springboard and that stands up in a platform.
And then I did this almost in the same way that you would do a computer chip.
I went to a clean room with a new silicon chip and I started working all the big machines for about 100 hours.
For the last material, I had to build my own machine -- to make this hole in a form of <unk> swimming that is under the device.
This device has the ability to be in a quantum figure, but for it it needs a little bit of help.
Let me make an analogy.
You know how awkward it is to be on a elevator full of people.
I mean, when I'm on an elevator alone, I do all kinds of weird, but then when other people go up with doing those things, because I don't want you to do it, or actually, <unk>
Quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects behave in the same way.
<unk> trip of inanimate objects are not only people, it's also the light that goes through and the wind that happens to the side and the heat of the room.
So we knew that if we wanted this little little bit of metal to behave in the quantum mechanics, we would have to drive all the other passenger ones.
And that's what we did.
<unk> the lights, then <unk> a <unk> and pulled out all the air, and we pulled it out to a temperature of less than a degree on absolute zero.
Now, when you're only in the <unk> the little piece of metal is free to act like it.
So we measured their motions.
I found that it moved in very strange ways.
Instead of staying perfectly still, I was vibrating. And the way that he <unk> was like a breath of this way -- like a <unk> that expands and <unk>
And by giving it a smooth drive, we were able to make it <unk> and you don't go back at the same time -- something that only happens with quantum mechanics.
So what I'm telling you is that I'm really fantastic.
What does it mean that one thing <unk> and they don't mean at the same time?
Let's think about atoms.
In one case, all of the trillion atoms that make up that piece of metal are still still and at the same time those same atoms are moving up and down.
It's just in certain <unk> when those are <unk>
In the rest of the time they're <unk>
It wants to say that every atom is in two different places at the same time, what it means is that the whole piece of metal is in two different places.
I think this is great.
Really.
<unk> <unk> in a clean room to do this for all of those years, because, look at this, the difference on scale between one atom and that little bit of metal is more or less the same as the difference between that little little metal and you.
So if one single atom can be in two different places at the same time, and that piece of metal can be in two different places, why not you too?
I mean, it's my kind of logic that talks about.
So just imagine if you were in several places at the same time, how would that be?
How do you act your consciousness if your body was <unk> in space?
There's another part of the story.
And this is when we put it up, and we turned the lights and we looked inside the box, we saw that the metal was still there in one piece.
And I could get to this new intuition, apparently all the objects on the elevator actually only are quantum objects that are just <unk> in a small space.
You hear a lot about that quantum mechanics is that everything is interconnected.
Well, that's not so true.
It's more profound than that.
It's that those connections, your connections to all the things that surround you, literally define who you are, and that's the deep strangeness of quantum mechanics.
Thank you.
My name is <unk>
And 18 months ago, I was doing another job at Google, until I launched the idea of doing something about museums and art to my head which is here and that allowed me to do it.
It took me 18 months and it took me.
A lot of negotiations and stories, you get to 17 very interesting museums in nine countries.
But I'm going to focus on the <unk>
There are a lot of stories about why we did.
I think my own story is explaining just in this slide, and this is the access.
I grew up in India.
<unk> from a great education, not <unk> but I didn't have access to many of these museums and artwork.
So when I started traveling and go to museums, I began to learn a lot.
And working at Google, I try to make the desire to make it more accessible by technology.
So we formed a team, a great team of people, and we started doing it.
So better than show the demo to then explain to you a couple of interesting things that we have led to place from their launch.
So, let's go to <unk>
Look around all the museums that are there.
There's the gallery gallery -- the <unk> the <unk> the <unk>
I'm actually going to go into one of my favorite ones, the <unk> the art museum in New York City.
There are two ways to do it -- very simple.
We click and <unk> we're already inside the museum.
It doesn't matter where they are, <unk> or <unk> that doesn't really matter.
You move around and <unk>
Do you want to navigate the <unk>
We open up the top, and with a single click, we jumped in.
They're inside, that you want to go at the end of the hall,
continue to go ahead and go.
<unk>
Thank you, but I haven't come to the best.
Now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings, "The <unk> of Pieter <unk> in the <unk>
I see the <unk> sign.
If the museum shows us the image, we click there.
See, this is one of the images.
Here's all the information <unk>
For those of you who are really interested in art, you can click there, but I'm going to click right here right now.
And this is one of the images we've captured in what we call the technology.
So this image, for example, <unk> I think, about 10,000 million <unk>
And there are many people who ask me, "What do you get with 10,000 million <unk>
So I'll show you what you really get with 10,000 million <unk>
You can zoom in into a very simple way.
You see things that are happening.
I love this guy, his expression has no price.
But if you really want to do it <unk>
So I started to play, and I found something that was going on there.
And I said, "A moment, this seems <unk>
And I went and discovered that children were actually playing something.
And I talked a little bit with some people from the <unk> and I actually discovered that this is a game called <unk> which is to hit a <unk> with a stick on the Tuesday <unk>
And apparently it was very popular.
I don't know why they did, but I've learned something about it.
And now we're going to get even deeper and you'll see that you can actually get even to the cracks.
Now just to give you a little bit of perspective, I'm going to remove the picture, so you'll see what there is.
Here's where we were, and this is the painting.
The best thing is to come, a second.
So now we're quickly quickly going to jump up again at MoMA in New York.
Here's another one of my favorites, "The night <unk>
The example I showed was to find details.
But what if you want to see the <unk>
And if you want to see how Van Gogh actually created this <unk>
It goes up and actually the fact that it does.
I'm going to one of my favorite parts in this picture, and I'm really going to get to the cracks.
This is <unk> <unk> I think I'd never seen it before.
I'm going to show you another one of my favorite functions.
There's a lot of things more here, but I don't have a time of <unk>
This is the really cool part. It's called <unk>
All of you, absolutely everyone, no matter whether it's rich or poor, or if you have a <unk> that gives you that way.
You can online to create their own museum, create its own collection from all of these images.
It's very simple, we walked in, I've created this function that I call "The power of <unk> -- we just made a zooming around it.
It's about <unk> at the National Gallery in London.
You can write things, send it to your friends and keep a conversation about what you feel at contemplating these works <unk>
So in conclusion, I think for me, the main thing is that all the amazing things really don't come from Google.
No, in my opinion, even come from museums.
Maybe I shouldn't say this.
Actually, they come from those artists.
And that's been my humble experience with this.
I mean, I hope that in this digital medium does justice to their artwork and it's represented properly online.
And the great question I'm doing today is, "You did this to repeat the experience of going to a <unk>
And the answer is no.
It's to supplement the experience.
And that's it. Thank you.
Thank you.
Good evening everybody.
I have something to show you.
Think it's a <unk> a pixel <unk>
In our lab, we call it sensitive design.
Let me tell you a little bit about this.
If you look at this picture -- I'm from Italian, all the kids in Italy grow up with this photo on the wall of your bedroom. But the reason I show you this is that has happened.
So sometime ago, if you wanted to win a fund of Formula 1, I would take a budget and get it to a good car and a good car.
And if the car and the car was good enough, you made the race.
This is what in engineering, you get <unk> in real time.
It's essentially a system that has two <unk> a sensor and a <unk>
Today what's interesting is that systems of control in real time are starting to go into our lives.
Our cities, over the last few years, have been covered with networks and electronics.
They're getting back to the open air.
And as <unk> they're starting to respond differently and they can be <unk> and <unk>
<unk> cities is a big thing.
As a note -- I wanted to mention that cities are only two percent of the cortex of the planet -- but they represent 50 percent of the world's population.
75 percent of the consumption of <unk> and to 80 percent of the CO2 emissions.
If we could do something with the cities, it would be a big thing.
Beyond the cities, all of these <unk> and <unk> are entering our everyday objects.
This is from an exhibition of <unk> <unk> for the weekends at MoMA, during the summer.
It's called <unk> Uncle <unk>
Well, our objects, the environment, start to <unk>
In a way, it's like almost all the existing atoms and <unk> and <unk>
And that's completely changing the interaction that as humans have with the outside environment.
In some sense it's almost like the old dream of Miguel <unk>
You know, when Michelangelo <unk> the <unk> was said that at the end, he took the <unk> and he threw it into the Moses -- you know, you can actually see a little <unk> <unk> and he said, <unk> <unk> <unk> -- and what don't you do?
Well, today, for the first time, our environment starts to <unk>
And I'm going to show you just about <unk> <unk> in the idea of getting the environment and turn something.
Let's start with the detection.
The first project I wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects of our lab.
This was four and a half years ago in Italy.
It was a summer in 2006.
It was the year that Italy won the World Cup <unk>
Maybe some of the remember, they played Italy and France, and at the end of <unk> he gave the <unk>
And anyway, the end won Italy.
Now let's see what happened that day is looking at activity based on the web.
Here we see the city.
You see the <unk> in the middle and the river <unk>
It's the morning before the game.
The timeline.
At the sooner early there are people around here, and there are <unk>
It starts the <unk> silence.
<unk> from France.
<unk> people make a quick call.
Second time. End of time.
First time <unk> second.
<unk> and at a moment, the <unk>
She makes Italy, yeah!
That night everyone went to <unk> the center.
There you see the big summit.
The next day they all went to the center of the winning and first minister of then.
And then everybody <unk>
You see the image of the place called <unk> <unk> where, in the age of <unk> people go to <unk> it's a great party, you can see the peak at the end of the day.
This is just an example of how you can now measure the pulse of the city in a way that we would not have done a few years ago.
Another quick example of <unk> is not about people, but things we use and we consume.
Today we know all about the provenance of our objects.
This is a map that shows all the chips that make up a Mac, how it gets <unk>
But we know very little about where things are.
So in this project we developed some small tags to track the garbage in their shift by the system.
We started with a few volunteers who helped us in Seattle a little more than a year, to tag what they were <unk> different kinds of things, as you can see, things that are all <unk>
Then we put a little chip on a chip, one tag <unk> and then we start <unk>
These are the <unk> results.
From <unk>
after a week.
With this information we realized there are a lot of <unk> in the system.
We can do the same with a lot less energy.
These are data that didn't exist before.
They're going on very complicated things and there's a lot of <unk>
But the other thing that we believe is that if you look at every day that the cup that we <unk> it doesn't come away, that's still somewhere on the planet.
That if the plastic bottle we <unk> a day is still there.
What if we show that to people, then we'll be able to promote some change of behavior.
That was the reason for the project.
My colleague at MIT, <unk> <unk> could tell us a lot more about detecting and many other cool things that we can do with that, but I wanted to go to the second part that we talked about at the beginning, which is the environment.
And the first project is something we did a couple of years ago in <unk>
It all started with a question of the mayor of the city, which came to us and told us that Spain and South Europe have a beautiful tradition of water in public space, in the architecture.
And the question was, how can technology, new technology join that one?
And one of the ideas that we developed at MIT, in a workshop was, imagine you have a <unk> and <unk> tubes of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
It was created as a curtain of water, with pixels of water.
If the pixels can be written into them, I'll show patterns, images, texts.
And when we zoom in, the curtain will open so that we can happen, as you see in the image.
We introduced this to the mayor <unk>
He liked it a lot.
And we would have a commission to design the building to the entrance to <unk>
We call it a <unk> <unk>
All the building is made of water.
There is no doors and no windows, but when you come up with it so that you can happen.
The roof is also covered in water.
And if there's a little bit of wind, if you want to minimize the <unk> it goes down the ceiling.
Or you can close the building and all architecture disappears, like this case.
Those days will always be somebody, in the winter, when you get the ceiling, someone who was there and said, <unk> the <unk>
No, it's not that you've got it, but when it goes down almost all the architecture goes down.
This is how it is.
You see the people who are going through what happens inside.
And here I'm myself trying to not be able to test the sensors that open the water.
I think I should tell you what happened one night when all the sensors stopped working.
That night was really more funny.
All the children of <unk> came to the building because the way we interact had changed a little bit.
It wasn't a building that would open up to let you happen, but a building that was still making <unk> and holes in water and one I had to jump up to not <unk>
<unk> <unk> And for us that was very interesting because as architects, engineers, designers, we always think of how people give our designs.
But then it's always unpredictable.
And that's the beauty of doing things to interact that people use.
This is an image of the building with the physical pixels and the pixels of water, and the projections of them.
And this is what led us to think about the next project I'm going to show you.
Imagine that those pixels could start flying.
Imagine that they could have little helicopters in the air and each one had a little pixel that changes color as if it was a cloud that moves in space.
This is the video.
Imagine a helicopter, as we saw before, which moves with other in synchrony.
We could form this cloud,
It's a kind of flexible screen like this with a normal configuration in two dimensions.
Or so in three dimensions, where what changes is light, not the <unk>
You can play with a different guy.
Imagine the screen appear in different scales and sizes, different kinds of resolution.
And then all of that could be a cloud of pixels in 3D where you can get closer and <unk> and see from very different perspectives.
This is the real <unk> <unk> going down to form a <unk> like before.
When the lights lights up, it looks like this.
Imagine each of them <unk> by a person.
We can have each pixel with an input that comes from people, the movement of people, etc., etc.
I want to show you something for the first time.
We've been working with <unk> <unk> <unk> of the best dancers of ballet reading today, the star of New York and <unk> <unk> to capture their 3D motions and use them as input to the <unk>
Here we can see <unk> dancing.
On the left-hand side, you see the <unk> <unk> in different <unk>
It's so much <unk> 3D <unk> as a movement capture.
It can make it all the movement.
You can go all the way.
And once we have the pixels we can play with them, with the color and the movement, with gravity and <unk>
We want to use this as a possible entry for <unk>
I wanted to show you the last project that we're working on.
It's something for the London Olympics.
It's called the <unk>
And the idea is, imagine again that we could engage people to do something and change our <unk> environment as an oyster nursery like <unk> <unk> but with a cloud.
Imagine that we could make it all a little <unk> a little bit for a <unk>
And I think the remarkable thing that has happened in the last few years is that, in the last two decades, we went from the physical world to the digital world.
We've digitized everything, as knowledge, and it's accessible to the Internet.
Today, for the first time -- and the Obama campaign <unk> we can move from the digital world, of the <unk> of the <unk> to the physical world.
In our case, this may be we wanted to use it to design and make a <unk>
That would mean something built in a city.
But tomorrow it can be to address the challenges of today: think about climate change or CO2 emissions, how to move from the digital world to the physical world?
The idea is that we can make people involved in doing this together, in a collective way.
The cloud is a cloud, again, made of pixels in the same way that the real cloud is a cloud of particles.
And those particles are water, whereas in our cloud are <unk>
It's a physical structure in London, but covered in the <unk>
You can move through the inside, having different experiences.
You can see from the bottom of the bottom of the main moments of the London Olympics and even more, and it can be used as a form of connection to the community.
So it's a physical cloud of the sky as something you can go up, like a new top of London.
You can go into there.
As if it was a new digital <unk> at night, but the most important thing is that it will be a new experience for anyone who goes to the top.
Thank you.
Would you like to be better than they are.
Suppose I told you that, with just a lot of changes in your genes, they could make it better <unk> for more accurate and faster.
Or maybe you would like to be in better ways, to have more resistance.
I'd like to be more attractive and secure for ourselves?
What about living more with good health?
Or maybe they're from those people who always wanted to be more creative.
What is the most <unk>
What would you like if you could choose something?
<unk> <unk> <unk>
How much people do creativity?
Hands up. Let me see.
<unk> probably got to the number of creative people present.
That's very good.
How many would you choose the memory?
A few more.
And the <unk> state.
A little less.
What about <unk>
Oh, most of them. That makes me feel very well.
If you could have some of this that the world would be very different.
It's just <unk>
Or maybe it's possible?
Evolution has been a <unk> theme here at the TED Conference but I want to give you the look of a doctor on the subject.
The great geneticist of the 20th century, <unk> <unk> who also <unk> in the <unk> Church, <unk> wrote a trial called <unk> in biology, it makes sense except for the light of the <unk>
But if you effectively accept biological evolution consider this: it's just about the past, or the future?
It refers to the other or us?
This is another look at the tree of life.
The human part of this branch is well at one end, it is, of course, most interest us.
<unk> of a common ancestor with modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago.
There's been perhaps 20 or 25 different species of <unk>
Some of them have gone and <unk>
We have been here a few years old.
It might seem like we're too far away from other parts of this tree of life, but actually in most of the basic machinery of our cells is more or less the same.
You realize that we can leverage and control the machinery of a common bacteria to produce the human insulin protein that is used to treat <unk>
This is not like human insulin -- but it's the same protein, chemically <unk> of the <unk>
And by talking about bacteria -- they realize that we all carry on the <unk> more bacteria than the cells that we have in the rest of the body?
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean, think -- when Antonio <unk> asks you about the <unk> you think about the <unk>
The gut is a wonderfully distressing environment for those bacteria.
It's warm dark, dark -- it's very <unk>
And we're going to give you all the nutrients that they can want to want to want to want no effort to want to want it.
It really is like a quick pathway for the bacteria with the occasional disruption of some hurry to the output.
But therefore we are a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they are essential for our life.
They help digest nutrients <unk> and protect us from certain diseases.
But what does the future?
We're in a kind of evolutionary equilibrium as a species?
Or destined to become something different, something maybe better <unk>
In this vast symphony symphony of the universe, the life on the Earth is like a brief <unk> the animal kingdom, as a single <unk> and the human life, a little bit of grace.
That was us.
And it was also the <unk> part of this talk, so I hope you've got it.
When I was just teaching college I had my first kind of biology.
I was fascinated by the elegance and the beauty of biology.
I fell in love with the power of evolution and realized something fundamental about the most existence of life, in the <unk> organisms -- every cell is simply divided and all the genetic energy of that cell is transmitted to the two male cells.
But when the organisms appear -- things start to change.
It goes into the scene in the <unk>
And something very important, with the emergence of sexual reproduction that goes through the genome, the rest of the body becomes <unk>
In fact, you might say that <unk> of the death of the body comes in evolution at the same time of sexual reproduction.
I have to argue that when I was a college student, I thought, well, <unk> <unk> death of <unk> seemed pretty reasonable at that moment, but with every year that was happening, I had more <unk>
I came to understand the feelings of George <unk> that still <unk> in Las Vegas in their 90 years.
And one night someone hits your front door.
He opens the door.
In front of him you find a wonderful dancing dancing dance.
He looks at it and he says, <unk> for a <unk> <unk>
He said, George, say, George, I choose the <unk>
I realized, as a doctor, who was working on a different target to the goal of the <unk> not necessarily <unk> just different.
I was trying to preserve the body.
I wanted it to be healthy.
I wanted to recover health in the disease.
I wanted us to live more and more healthy.
Evolution consists of passing the genome into the next <unk> <unk> and <unk> generation after generation.
From an evolutionary point of view, you and I are as a <unk> rockets designed to send genetic charge to the next level, and then let us fall into the sea.
I think we all hate the feeling that Woody Allen when he said, "I don't want to get the immortality through my work.
I want to <unk> <unk>
Evolution doesn't necessarily blame longevity.
It doesn't necessarily be inspired by the biggest or the stronger or the faster and even the smarter.
Evolution encourages creatures best adapted to their environment.
That's the only proof of survival and success.
In the bottom of the ocean -- the bacteria <unk> that they can survive the heat of the <unk> that <unk> if there were fish there, fish attached to <unk> and yet they've managed to make that a <unk> environment.
So what does this mean when we look at what's happening in evolution and if we go back to thinking about the place of humans in evolution, and in particular, if we look forward to the <unk> phase I would argue that there are many possibilities.
The first is that we don't know.
We've reached a kind of balance.
And the data underlying it would be that through medicine, first of all, we've known to preserve a lot of genes that otherwise would have been <unk> and separated from the population.
And secondly, as a species, we have <unk> our environment to be adapted to us as well as we adapt to it.
And by the way, <unk> <unk> and we are so excited that it's no longer possible to have the necessary isolation for evolution.
A second possibility is that there is a evolution of the traditional traditional type, imposed by the forces of nature.
And the argument here is, the gears of evolution roll slowly, but they're <unk>
And as soon as the <unk> as a species -- distant planets are going to be going to exist and the environmental changes that can produce natural <unk>
But there is a third possibility -- a bad possibility and scary.
And I call it <unk> the new evolution, which is not just <unk> but <unk> and elected for us as individuals in the decisions that we have.
Now, how could this happen?
How could we get to do this?
We first consider the reality that many people today, in some cultures, are making decisions about their offspring.
In some cultures, they are choosing to have more male males than women.
It's not necessarily good for society, but it's what you choose at the individual and family level.
Just think that if you could be able to be able to choose not only the sex of their <unk> but in your own body to make genetic rewards to cure or prevent diseases.
And if we could make genetic changes to eliminate diabetes or Alzheimer's or reduce the risk of cancer or eliminate the <unk>
You wouldn't want to make those changes in your <unk>
If we look at the future that kind of change is going to be increasingly possible.
The Human Genome Project started in 1990 and he sued 13 years.
<unk> <unk> million dollars.
In the next year of being done, in 2004, I could do the same job for 20 million dollars in three or four months.
Today, you can get a full sequence of the three billion base pairs of the human genome at a cost near 20,000 and a week.
No good for us to actually make the human genome for <unk> and be more and more at the reach of all.
They come up with those changes.
The same technology that has produced human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that are not only going to protect us from themselves, but they will induce immunity against other viruses.
<unk> or there is no experimental trial in the course with the flu flu in a plant of plants.
Can you imagine something good that comes out of the <unk>
That's reality today and the future is going to be more and more possible.
Imagine then only other two <unk>
They can change the cells of their bodies but if they could change the cells of their <unk>
And if they could change the sperm and the <unk> or change the newly <unk> egg and give their children a better chance of a healthier life to remove the diabetes, to remove the <unk> reduce the risk of cancer?
Who doesn't want the children more <unk>
And then, that same analytical technology, that same engine of science that can produce the changes to prevent diseases that are going to allow us to also adopt <unk> <unk> a better memory.
Why don't you have the ingenuity of a Ken <unk> especially if you could do it with the next generation of the <unk> machine.
Why don't you have a <unk> muscle that allowed us to run faster and more <unk>
Why don't you live longer?
This is going to be <unk>
And when we are in conditions to pass this to the next generation and we can adopt the attributes that we wanted to become the evolution of before the <unk>
We're going to take a process that normally could take 100,000 years, and we can take it to 1,000 years and maybe happen within the next 100 years.
These are choices that their grandchildren, or the grandchildren of their grandchildren, are going to have to have them.
We're going to use these options in order for a better society, more successful to <unk>
Or, let's choose selectively different attributes that we want for some of us but not to the others?
We're going to build a society that is more boring and more the uniform or more robust and more <unk>
This is the kind of question we're going to have to face.
And most of all, we're going to be able to develop the wisdom and of inherit the wisdom needed to make these <unk> decisions.
For worse, and before what I could do is, these options are going to depend on us.
Thank you.
Imagine a big explosion when you're at 900 feet tall.
Imagine a plane full of smoke.
Imagine a motor doing <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> It sounds terrifying.
Well, I had a single seat that day, I was sitting in the <unk>
It was the only one I could talk to the flight flights.
So I immediately looked at them, and they said, "There's no problem. You probably slam <unk>
The pilot had already <unk> the airplane, and we weren't so far.
You could see Manhattan.
Two minutes later, three things happened at the same time.
The car driver, the airplane with the Hudson River.
Mostly that's not the road.
<unk> the motors.
Imagine being on a plane and without <unk>
And then he said three words.
The three <unk> words I've heard of.
He said, <unk> for the <unk>
I didn't have to talk more with the flight assistant.
I was able to see it in your eyes.
It was terror. Life is <unk>
I want to share with you three things I learned about myself that day.
I learned that everything changes in a moment.
We have this list of things to do before they die, these things that we want to do in life, and I thought about all the people I wanted to get in and didn't do it, all the fences I wanted to remove all the experiences that I've wanted to have and never <unk>
While I was thinking about that later. I came up with a phrase, which is, <unk> wines <unk>
Because if the wine is ready and the person is there, I'm going to open.
I don't want to <unk> anything in life.
And that urgency, that purpose, has really changed my life.
The second thing I learned was that day -- and this is as I put the bridge -- the George Washington, which was not very much -- I thought about, Wow, I really feel a big <unk>
I've lived a good life.
In my humanity and my mistakes I've been trying to improve everything I did.
But in my humanity also gave up my ego.
And I am sorry for the time that we were doing in things that didn't care about people who matter.
And I thought about my relationship with my wife, with my friends, with people.
And then, as <unk> in that, I decided to remove the negative energy of my life.
It's not perfect, but it's a lot better.
In two years, I haven't had a fight with my wife.
It feels like <unk>
I'm not trying to have <unk> <unk> being <unk>
The third thing I learned -- and this is like your mental clock is going to be <unk> <unk> 14, <unk>
You see the water <unk>
I'm saying, "Please <unk>
I don't want this to be broken in 20 pieces as you see in those <unk>
And as I <unk> I had the feeling of, Wow, it's not scary.
It's almost like we've been <unk> for all of our life.
But it was very sad.
I didn't want to <unk> I love my life.
And that sadness is <unk> in a single thought, which is, I just wish one thing.
I wish I could see my children growing up.
A month later, I was in a performance of my daughter -- first grade, not a lot of artistic talent.  And I scream, <unk> as a little boy.
And for me, that was the whole reason to be in the world.
And at that point I realized that the two points, that the only thing that matters in my life is to be a great father.
For all, the only goal I have in life is to be a good father.
I was awarded a miracle, not to die that day.
And he gave me another gift, which was the chance to look at the future and go back and live in a way.
You are flying today, the challenge that you can imagine that the same thing happens on your plane -- and for for it not as well as -- but imagine, and how to <unk>
What are you going to assume that they still expect to do because they think they're going to live <unk>
How do your relationships change and negative energy in them?
And most importantly, they are the best parents to <unk>
Thank you.
I've clearly been <unk> in life with many different projects.
But the most cool thing I worked was for this guy.
The guy is called <unk>
<unk> was one of the most important <unk> in the 1980s.
One day came to his house after running and said, "Daddy, I feel a <unk> in the <unk>
And that was the beginning of ALS.
<unk> today has a complete <unk>
You can only use your eyes.
Her job influenced me.
I have a design company and animation -- so obviously, graffiti is a intricate thing that we admire and <unk> in the world of art.
So we decided that we were going to go to <unk> <unk> and their cause.
So I went and met with her brother and her father and said, "We're going to give you this money.
What are you going to do with <unk>
And his brother said, "I only want to be able to talk to Tony again.
I just want to be able to communicate with him and that he's able to communicate with me."
And I said, "A second is not that <unk> seen Stephen <unk> not that all the people with paralysis can be able to communicate through those <unk>
And he said, "No, unless you be someone important and you have a good insurance -- you can't actually do it.
These devices are not affordable for people."
And I said, "Well, how do they communicate then?"
Did anybody see the movie "The <unk> and the <unk>
They communicate that way, they will make it <unk>
I said, "That's <unk> How could it be?"
So I showed up with the only desire to deliver a check and instead of that signed a check that didn't have the least idea of how I was going to <unk>
I was obsessed with her brother and her father there at the very precise moment, "All right, this is Tony <unk> I'm going to talk to you to build a machine, and we're going to find a way to make her art again.
Because it's ridiculous that someone who has so much on their inside cannot be <unk>
So I spoke at a conference a couple of months later.
I met these guys called <unk> <unk> Research <unk> who have a technology that lets them project a light on any surface and then with a laser slum, you draw on that and register negative space.
So they go through making art facilities like this.
All the things that <unk> they say, are part of a life cycle.
They first start with sexual organs, then with the bad words, then with the Bush attacks and in the end, people start to do art.
But there was always a life cycle in their <unk>
And so it started the journey.
And a few years later, about a year later, after a year later, after a lot of organization and a lot of organization and a lot of organization we had achieved a couple of things.
One, you touch the doors of the safe insurance companies, and we got a machine that would be able to <unk> a machine like Stephen <unk>
Which was great.
And seriously, it's the most <unk> I call it <unk> because when I talk to you with the guy you get an email from him, and you say, "Don't <unk> this guy's <unk>
The other thing we did was to bring seven programmers from all over the world <unk> from all the corners of <unk> to our house.
My wife, the kids and I, we moved to the garage and these hackers and programmers and <unk> and <unk> took control of the house.
A lot of our friends thought we were doing something completely stupid and that when they were going, they would have removed the frames of the walls and their place would have <unk>
But for two weeks, we went to <unk> <unk> my son was part of my dog as well, and we created this.
It's called <unk> <unk> And you can see the <unk>
They are a couple of plastic sunglasses that we bought on the <unk> <unk> Beach, some copper wire and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
We took a camera -- the <unk> we put it up on a light of LED light, and there's a device that is free -- and it builds one <unk> we published the software <unk> the software is low in a <unk>
And we created a device that has no limitation at all.
There's no insurance company.
There's no hospital that can say <unk>
Any person with paralysis today has access to draw and communicate using your eyes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much for you. That's awesome.
So at the end of the two weeks we come back to the <unk> room.
I love this picture because this is the room of another person, and that's his room.
There was all this <unk> and <unk> during the great opening.
And after a year of planning, two weeks of planning on the entire night, Tony came back to draw for the first time in seven years.
And this is a wonderful picture because this is the support system of life and is looking through the support system of your life.
We ran the bed to the bed so I could see.
And we put a projector on a wall of the parking lot of the hospital.
And he came back to drawing for the first time in front of his family and friends -- and you can imagine what was the feeling in the parking lot.
The funny thing was that we had to take on the parking lot, so we feel like we were <unk> graffiti as well.
At the end of this, he sent us an email and this was what he said, "This was the first time he was drawing in seven years.
I felt like he had been under the water and someone finally came up to <unk> and would take me out of there so that I could <unk>
It's not <unk>
In a way, that's our scream for war.
That's what keeps us in the motion, <unk>
And we have a long way to walk with this.
It's a cool device, but it's the equivalent of a <unk> <unk>
Someone with this artistic potential deserves much more.
So we're trying to figure out how to <unk> and make it faster and robust.
Since then we've had all kinds of recognition.
We've won a lot of awards.
Remember, it's <unk> none of us is making money with this.
Everything comes out of our own pockets.
The prizes were like, "Oh, this is great!"
Armstrong <unk> something about us, and then in December, Time magazine acknowledged us as one of the 50 best inventions of 2010, and it was really cool.
The best thing about all of this -- and this is what ends up from close to the <unk> is that in April of this year in <unk> <unk> at the middle of Los Angeles is going to be an exhibition called <unk> in the <unk>
And <unk> in <unk> is going to have the best <unk> of the urban art, <unk> <unk> <unk> all of them will be there.
<unk> is going to be on the show which is pretty impressive.
So, basically this is my idea: if you see something that isn't possible, do it possible.
None of what you have in this room was possible -- the stage, the computer, the microphone, the <unk> nothing was possible at a moment.
Do it <unk> anything in this room.
I'm not a programmer, I never did anything with <unk> recognition technology, I just recognized something and <unk> with wonderful people to be able to make it happen.
And these are the questions that I want everyone to do every day when we find something that we feel like to do. If it's not now, <unk> And if I'm not me, who?
Thank you guys.
I have spent the last few years in situations usually very difficult and at the same time as much dangerous.
I went to the hard <unk>
I worked on a <unk> mine in a dangerous <unk>
<unk> in areas of <unk> difficult and dangerous.
And I spent 30 days to eat only this fun -- kind of hard to the beginning, very dangerous in the middle, very dangerous at the end.
In fact, in a great part of my career, I've been <unk> in situations in appearance of the only goal of trying to examine social questions in ways that <unk> <unk> interesting, and, hopefully, analyzing in a way that they see cool and accessible to the audience.
So when I knew I was coming here to do a TEDTalk on the world of brands and <unk> I wanted to do something a little different.
So some of you may have heard of it, or not, a couple weeks ago, I took a <unk> <unk>
I sent some messages on Facebook, some on Twitter, I volunteered to sell the rights of the name of my TEDTalk in 2011.
What had been the following: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> my TEDTalk that you don't have any idea what it is about and as content could be, in the face, especially if I put it on ridicule to you or your company to do it.
But I said this, it's a very good opportunity to <unk>
Do you know how many people look at these <unk>
<unk>
It's a degree in progress, by the way.
So even with that <unk> I knew someone was going to buy the rights of the name.
If you had asked him a year ago, I would have had no <unk> for certainty.
But in the new film that I'm working on, we tested the <unk> of <unk>
And as I said earlier, I've been involved in horrible situations in the last few years, but nothing I could do was <unk> nothing to be so difficult or as dangerous as entering the rooms with these guys.
You see, I had this idea for a movie.
Morgan <unk> I want to make a film that I tried to do a film that I try to do a film -- marketing and advertising, and all the entire film <unk> with <unk> of products, marketing and advertising.
The film is going to call "The largest film ever <unk>
What happens in "The largest movie ever, is that all of the top up at the bottom of the end, it has a brand images of brand, all the time; from the <unk> that appears before the title of the title, the mark on the title.
Now this brand, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
These people were <unk> in the film to <unk> forever.
And so the film explores all this idea, <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> It's <unk> A <unk> <unk>
I am a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> it was more for <unk>
He was <unk> <unk>
But we're not just going to have the <unk> of the X in the title but we're going to make sure we will take all the categories that we could in the film.
Maybe we put a shoe, and it becomes the most cool shoe that you have <unk>
The most cool car that you lead to "The largest film that you lead to "The largest movie -- the best drink that you have <unk> <unk> of "The largest film ever <unk>
<unk> <unk> The idea is then in addition to showing you the brands as part of life, make them <unk> the <unk> <unk> making it <unk> <unk> MS: And we actually showed the whole process of how it works.
The goal of the entire film is transparency.
You'll see all the process in this movie.
That's the whole idea, all the shot of beginning to end.
And I would love to help you to help us make it happen.
Robert <unk> You know, it's funny because it's the first time I hear -- it's the most respect for the audience.
<unk> However, I don't know how <unk> it's going to be people to that.
<unk> You have a <unk> -- I don't know if you're very <unk> but you know how to <unk> <unk> <unk> David <unk> How much money does it need to do this?
MS: One and a half and a half -- John <unk> I think it's going to be hard to get the meeting with them, but it certainly is going to be worth convincing a couple of big brands here.
<unk> Who knows, maybe for the moment that the movie is going to look like a whole bunch of idiots <unk>
MS: What do you think is going to be the answer?
Stuart <unk> Most of the answers will be <unk>
MS: But it will be hard to <unk> by the film or to me?
JK:
MS: So -- -- it means you're not very optimistic.
So, I need help. I need help.
MK: I can help.
MS: All right. <unk> <unk> Awesome.
MK: We need to think about what brands.
MS: Yeah. <unk>
MK: We have some places where to go, <unk> <unk> the camera.
MS: So I thought <unk> <unk> meant we have a conversation outside the microphone.
<unk> the camera means "We don't want to know anything about your <unk>
MS: And so it was, one by one, all these companies are suddenly gone.
No wanted to have anything to do with this movie.
I was surprised.
They didn't want to know anything with this project.
And I was very <unk> I thought the concept of advertising, was to present the product to as many people as possible, so so so many people saw it as possible.
Especially in the world today this intersection of new media and old media and the stage of the separate media -- it's not the idea of that new vehicle worth of attention to the <unk>
No, that's what I thought.
But the problem was, you know, my idea had a <unk> error and that mistake was this.
In reality, it wasn't such a mistake.
There was no error at all.
This would have been well.
But the problem was what this image.
See, when you search for <unk> images in Google <unk>   -- this is one of the first images that showed up.
I like your way of <unk> Sergey Brin: No.
This was the problem: <unk> free of simulation or <unk> easily detected or <unk> easily <unk> which is characterized by the visibility or access of information, especially in the practices of <unk> being the last line perhaps the larger problem.
You see, we heard a lot about transparency in these days.
Our politicians <unk> the president the <unk> even the <unk>
But suddenly when it's trying to make it really something changes very much.
But why? Well, the transparency gives you <unk> -- like that weird bear that keeps <unk>
It's <unk>   Like this strange rural path.
And it's too risky.
What else is it <unk>
<unk> a whole bowl of <unk> <unk>
That's very risky.
When I started talking to companies and tell you that we wanted to tell this story, and they said, "No, we want you to <unk> history.
We want to have a story, but we want to make a story -- <unk> story."
See, when I was a kid, and my father would lie to me in some lie -- and there he was looking at me as a <unk> saying, "Son, there are three sides in every story.
There's your story, it's my story, and there's the story <unk>
As you can see, in this film we wanted to tell the real story.
But with only one company, an agency wanting to help me -- and that just because I knew John Bond and Richard <unk> of many years -- I realized I would have to go through my own, it would have to take out the <unk> and go to the companies myself.
So what I started to figure out is that I started giving me <unk> is that when you start talking to the companies the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem.
MS: So I have friends who make big films -- giant giants and others who make small, independent movies, like mine.
And my friends who make films of big Hollywood films say that the reason that their movies are so successful is that the brands have that they have.
And then my friends who make independent films say, "Well, how are we supposed to compete with these big, giant movies of <unk>
And the movie is called "The largest film <unk>
How are we going to see specifically <unk> in the movie?
Every time I'm going to go out, every time I open my <unk> you'll see the <unk> <unk>
At any time during an interview with someone can say "You're good for this <unk>
You're ready? You see a little bit nervous.
I want you to help you to help you.
Maybe you should get a little bit of this before the <unk>
And there would be one of these <unk> <unk>
Both <unk> <unk> as <unk> of <unk> are going to have their opportunity.
We're going to have so much for man as to <unk> solid, to <unk> it to <unk>
That's the big look.
Now I can answer your questions and give them a look at <unk>
Karen Frank: We are a small number.
<unk> the kind of little movies that we <unk> we're more good at a <unk> brand.
So we don't have the budget to have other brands.
So do things like this, you know, remind you <unk> people is the reason why this is interested.
MS: What words would they use to describe <unk>
<unk> is white.
<unk> That's a great question.
Volunteer: science.
MS: Technology is not the way you want to describe something that you put in the <unk>
Man: We talk about something audacious, <unk>
I think <unk> is a great word that actually puts this category in positive versus <unk> the smell and the <unk>
It keeps you.
How do we keep you cool over time with better <unk> more <unk> three times <unk>
Things like those who <unk> the benefits.
MS: And that's a <unk> company.
What about me? What about a common guy.
I need to talk to the man in the street, people like me, to the <unk>
They have to tell me about my brand.
MS: How do you define your <unk>
Man: <unk> my <unk>
I don't know.
I like the good clothing.
Woman: revive <unk> <unk> <unk> unless it is <unk>
MS: All right, what is the brand <unk>
<unk> Something unique. <unk> <unk> <unk> I guess the kind of gender, the style I have would be like a <unk> <unk>
I like a lot of dark colors, many gray colors, a lot of things like that.
Usually I carry you like <unk> or the <unk> or the <unk>
Woman: If Dan was a brand could be a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Man 2: The brand that I am, I would call it <unk> <unk>
Woman 2: In part of <unk> in part of <unk> <unk> I don't know.
Man 3: I'm the kind of pet guy.
<unk> toys to pets in the country and in the world.
So I guess that's my brand.
In my little sector, that's my brand.
Man 4: My brand is FedEx because he <unk> the <unk>
Man 5: <unk> <unk> failure.
Is that something?
<unk> I'm a brand <unk>
<unk> I'm a <unk>
MS: Well, we can't all be a brand brand -- but often I was <unk> at the intersection of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I realized I needed an expert.
I needed someone who could enter my head, someone who could help me understand what they call the <unk> <unk>
And I found a company called <unk> <unk> in Pittsburgh.
They helped companies like <unk> <unk> <unk> to discover that personality personality.
If they were able to do it for them, they could surely do it for me.
<unk> <unk> the photos, right?
MS: Yeah. The first picture is a family photograph.
A: Tell me a little bit of how it relates to your thoughts and feelings your self.
MS: These people shape my way to see the world.
A: Tell me from that world.
MS: That's the world? I think your world is the world that <unk> like people around you, your friends, your family, the way you live in your life, the work that you do.
All of those things come out and start in a place and in my case where they start and start in my family, in West Virginia.
A: What's the next thing you want to talk about.
MS: The next one is "This was the best day of my life."
A: How does this relate to your thoughts, feelings and your way to be?
MS: It's like who I'd like to be me.
I like different things.
I like the weird stuff. I like the weird stuff.
A: Tell me about the <unk> what does that do for us?
What is the <unk> What phase of <unk> you find you now?
Why is it important? What is <unk>
Tell me a little bit about that.
A bit more of you, which is not who you are.
What other <unk> have you <unk>
You don't have to have a fear of what kind of rollercoaster are you?
MS: <unk> <unk> Thank you.)
A: thank you for your patience. You know, Great <unk> A: Yes. Thank you very much.) All right.
MS: Yeah, I don't know what's going to go out of this.
There was a lot of madness to all this.
<unk> <unk> The first thing I saw was this idea that there are two different sides but <unk> in your personality personality -- the <unk> Morgan <unk> is a <unk> brand.
They were pretty good together.
And I think there's almost a paradox in them.
And I believe that some companies will only become one of their strong dots or in the other instead of focusing on both.
A lot of companies tend to have -- and it's nature's nature to avoid the things that are not <unk> their fear, those elements, and you actually make a good thing for you, and it's nice to see that.
What other brands are this?
The first here is the classic <unk>
And you can also see here to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Now there are <unk> brands and you have -- those things that have gone and come in but a <unk> brand is quite powerful.
MS: A <unk> <unk> What's your <unk>
If someone asks you to get your brand -- your brand, your brand, what would that be?
Are you a <unk> attribute you're someone who makes blood <unk>
Or are you more a <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> attributes are like being playful to be cool like <unk> contemporary <unk> <unk> <unk> or bold like <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> or mystical or mystical ones.
Or are you more of the attribute of <unk>
You're conscious -- sophisticated as <unk>
Are you <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
You are good, stable familiar, <unk> sure, sacred, <unk> or wise as the Dalai Lama or <unk>
In the course of this film we had over 500 companies, <unk> and <unk> who said <unk> they didn't want to be part of this project.
They didn't want to have anything to do with this film, mostly because they wouldn't have control, you would have no control over the final product.
And they allowed us to tell the story of the <unk> and we got to tell the story in this movie of how we now use magnetic resonance to identify the centers of desire as much for commercial marketing in the brain as well as a movie for the movies.
We went to St. Paulo where they have banned advertising to the open.
All over the city for the last five years, there's no <unk> there's no <unk> there's nothing.
And we went to school districts where companies are getting on the way in schools in the U.S. issues in the U.S.
The amazing thing to me is that the projects that I've had the biggest answer or what I've had more success are those in which I've interacted with things directly.
And that's what these brands.
<unk> the <unk> took off their agencies, and they said maybe these agencies don't have my best interest in mind.
I'm going to try directly to the artist.
I'm going to work with him to create something different, something that is going to do to think of people, which is going to challenge the way we look at the world.
And how has he gone? They did success?
Well, since the film was released in the <unk> <unk> let's take a look.
According to <unk> the film was released in January, and since this is not <unk> we've had 900 million impressions of the media for this film.
This covers only a two-year period, a half.
That's just <unk> or press or TV.
The movie is still not <unk>
It's still not online. It's not in <unk>
It's not even presented in other countries yet.
Ultimately, this film has already begun to make momentum.
And it's not bad because it's almost all the agencies that we talk to you about to their customers not to be a part.
And I've always believed that if you get a <unk> if you take risks, that in those risks there are opportunity.
I think when you get people out of that being pushing it to failure.
I think when you train their employees in the aversion to risk it's preparing their entire company for <unk>
I feel that what has to happen to progress is that we have to encourage people to <unk>
We need to encourage people who are not afraid of the opportunities they can <unk>
Ultimately, we will go, I think we need to give it to fear.
We have to put that bear in a cage.
<unk> fear <unk>
From a <unk> at the time, we have to embrace risk.
And ultimately, we have to harbor transparency.
Now more than a little bit of honesty is going to go a long way.
And I said that, with honesty and transparency, all of my talk -- <unk> has been presented by my good friends of <unk> who for <unk> bought the rights of the name in <unk>
<unk> <unk> big data in large opportunities for companies around the world.
<unk> presents <unk> <unk>
Thank you very much.
June Cohen: So, <unk> in the name of transparency, which happened exactly with those <unk>
MS: That's a fantastic question.
In my pocket I have a check on behalf of the TED matrix, the Foundation, and a check for <unk> to be applied to my <unk> for TED next year.
The idea behind the <unk> <unk> is actually very simple.
We don't want Iran to get the nuclear bomb.
Their highest asset to develop nuclear weapons is the plant of <unk> in <unk>
The gray boxes that you see are systems of control in real time.
If we managed to compromise these systems that control speeds and <unk> we can cause a lot of problems with <unk>
The gray boxes don't use <unk> software is a completely different technology.
But if we were able to put a <unk> virus on a laptop used by an engineer to set up this gray, then we're smart.
This is the plan behind <unk>
We started with a <unk>
The <unk> enters the gray box, hurts the <unk> and the nuclear nuclear program is <unk> mission.
It's easy, <unk>
I want to tell you how we discovered this.
When we started looking at <unk> six months ago, the purpose was completely unknown.
The only thing that was known is that it's very, very complex in the <unk> the <unk> wore multiple <unk>
It seemed to want to do something with these <unk> <unk> these control systems.
That called us the attention, and we started an experiment in which we were going to put up our environment with <unk> and we saw what was going on with this.
So they got very strange things.
<unk> was <unk> like a lab rat who didn't like our <unk> the wave, but I didn't want to eat.
I had no sense for me.
And then we experience with different flavors of cheese, I realized, and I thought, this is a <unk> attack.
It's completely <unk>
The <unk> is looking at active in the gray box, if you find a certain configuration, and even if the program that is trying to infect is effectively working on that place: though.
If not, <unk> does nothing.
So that called my attention, and we started working on this almost 24 hours a day, because we said, "We don't know what's the <unk>
It might be, let's say for example, a power plant plant, or a chemical plant in Germany.
So better than you would take the goal soon.
So we pulled out and <unk> the attack, and we found that it was <unk> in two <unk> bombs.
We also saw that they were armed with very professionally with people who obviously had all the internal information.
They were all the points to attack.
You probably even know how much the operator.
So you know everything.
And if you've heard that <unk> <unk> is complex and high technology, let me say, the burden is very complex.
It's very much above everything we've seen before.
So here you see a sample of this code in attack.
We're talking about 15,000 lines of code.
It looks pretty much like old language <unk>
I want to tell you how we could find meaning to this code.
What we were looking at at the beginning were called the system functions because we know what they do.
Then we were looking at <unk> and data structures and try to engage you with the real world, with potential goals in the real world.
We need theories about how they could pass or <unk>
To get to theories about goals, we remember that it's definitely a violent <unk> it must be a <unk> white and it's probably located in Iran, because it's where most of the infections have been <unk>
They don't find several thousand targets in that area.
It basically boils down to the plant of nuclear power plant and the plant of <unk> <unk>
So I told my <unk> <unk> a list of all the experts in <unk> and power plants between our <unk>
I called them and I asked them to an effort for <unk> their experience with what we find on code and data.
And it worked pretty well.
So we were able to associate the little digital <unk> with the control of the <unk>
The rotor is that cell part inside the <unk> that black object that you see.
If they run the speed of this <unk> they can certainly <unk> and even make it <unk>
What we also saw is that the goal of the attack was to make it slow and <unk> in one obvious effort to go back to the nest engineer, so that they couldn't solve this quickly.
We're trying to figure out the big digital <unk> looking very close to the data and their structures.
So for example, the number <unk> <unk> on that code, you can't get <unk>
So I started looking at scientific literature about how these <unk> are built in <unk> and I found that they're <unk> in what's called a <unk> and each <unk> contains <unk> <unk>
That made sense, there was a coincidence.
And it got better yet.
These <unk> in Iran are <unk> in 15 parts called stages.
And guess what do we find on the code of <unk>
A almost <unk> structure.
So again, that was a good coincidence.
This gave us a lot of confidence in understanding what we had between hands.
So there was no <unk> not like this.
The results have been that after several weeks of hard work.
<unk> <unk> in dead ends.
And yet, we found that both digital <unk> were going to be a single <unk> but from different perspectives.
The small <unk> is taking a <unk> and making the <unk> and <unk> and the big thing communicates with six and manipulating <unk>
In <unk> we are very confident that we've determined what is <unk>
It's <unk> and it's just <unk>
We should not worry that other goals are <unk> by <unk>
So here I show you some very interesting things that we saw, really <unk>
That's the gray, and the top you see the <unk>
What this thing does is <unk> the input values for example, for example of the pressure sensors and the sensors of vibration and provides code -- which is still running by the attack, with false data <unk>
And believe it or not, this <unk> data is <unk> by <unk>
It's like the Hollywood movies where, during the <unk> the security camera feeds in <unk>
It's great <unk>
The idea here is obviously not just <unk> the operators in the <unk>
It's really much more dangerous and <unk>
The idea is <unk> a digital security system.
We need digital security systems where a human operator could not be quick.
For example, in a power plant, when the big steam turbine is going to be <unk> you have to become a loss of escape <unk>
Obviously, this can't do it a human operator, a human.
That's where we need digital security.
And when they're <unk> then they can pass bad things.
The plant can explode.
And the <unk> and the security system <unk>
That scares you.
But it can be worse.
What I'm going to say is very important.
Think about this. This attack is <unk>
There's nothing to see, specifically, with <unk> with <unk> <unk>
It could work too, for example, in a power plant, or a car factory.
It's <unk>
And you don't have <unk> <unk> to disseminate this burden with a <unk> key, as we saw in the case of <unk>
You could also use conventional technology for <unk>
It will be able to make it more possible.
And if you made that, with what <unk> is with a <unk> of mass destruction.
That's the consequence we need to face.
Unfortunately, the largest number of goals for such attacks is not in the Middle East.
It's in the United States and in Japan.
All the green areas are places with large numbers of goals.
We need to face the consequences and better than we begin to make now.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I have a question.
<unk> has been done in many sides that people assumed that <unk> is the main entity behind this.
What is your <unk>
Ralph <unk> Okay, really want to listen to this?
Yeah. <unk>
My guess is that <unk> is involved, but the engine is not <unk>
The engine behind this is the ultimate <unk>
There's one alone, and that's the United States, fortunately, <unk>
Because otherwise our problems would be even greater.
CA: Thank you for <unk> Thank you, <unk>
So I want you to imagine a robot that can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to make users of lawn chairs and raise them again.
In <unk> <unk> we call these robots, <unk>
It's nothing different than something that you put in the morning, gives you a big force -- that also increases your speed, and help for example, drive the balance.
It's actually the real integration of the man and the machine.
But not only that -- it can integrate it and connect it to the universe and with other things.
This is not a <unk> idea.
To show you now in what we're working on, we started talking about the American soldier who, on average, has to take a quarter of 45 pounds, and it's <unk> to get even more equipment.
Obviously, this leads to some major complications -- lesions in their back, 30 percent of the soldiers -- with chronic <unk>
We decided to look at this challenge and create a exoskeleton that could help drive the matter.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> -- or <unk> <unk> Human Human
Soldier: With the exoskeleton <unk> I can <unk> 90 pounds for <unk> for many hours.
Their flexible design allows you to put in <unk> <unk> and running movements with great <unk>
I think what I want to do, or where I want to go, and then it increases my strength and my resistance.
<unk> <unk> We're ready, with our industrial partner to produce this device, this new <unk> this year.
I mean, it's a reality.
Let's go back to the users of lawn chairs about what I'm particularly passionate about.
There are 68 million people on the bottom of the wheels, all over the world.
Like one percent of the population.
And this is a really conservative calculation here.
We talk about something that happens with very young people, with damage to the spinal cord that when they start their life -- to 20, 30 or 40 years -- they collide against a wall and the wheelchair turns out to be their only option.
We also talk about the population that gets twice as fast as they are used.
Their only option, many times -- because of a brain injury or some other <unk> -- is the wheelchair.
And this has been so for the last 500 years, from its successful <unk> as I must recognize.
So we decided to start by writing a new chapter on mobility.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> which is using Amanda <unk> who was 19 years ago had a injury in the column -- and as a result he couldn't go back for 19 years old, so far.
Amanda <unk> Thank you.
EB: Amanda is using our <unk> that <unk>
It has some sensors on it.
It's completely not <unk> in the crutches that send signals to the computer computer here on the back.
There are also a few batteries that give the motors into the <unk> and on the knees, and they make it progress on this soft and very natural <unk>
AB: I was 24 years at the top of my life when, for a strange jump in the air, skiing around it was <unk>
In a fraction of a second, I lost all sensation and all of the <unk> movement.
Little time later, a doctor went to my room in the hospital, and he said, <unk> never come back to <unk>
That was 19 years ago.
So he stole me to the last little bit of hope for my self.
<unk> technology since then, has allowed me to learn to <unk> it costs <unk> to climb rocks and even ride on a bicycle <unk>
But they've never invented me to walk, until now.
Thank you.
EB: As you can see, we have the technology, we have the platforms to sit and talk to you.
It's in our hands, and we have all the potential here to change life to future future -- not just soldiers, but Amanda, and all the users of lawn chairs all of us.
AB: Thank you.
I've just come back from a community that has the secret of human survival.
It's a place where women have the <unk> practice sex to say hello, and play is the order of the day -- where fun is serious.
And no, it's not the <unk> Man festival or San Francisco.
Ladies and gentlemen, you know their cousins.
This is the world of the wild Bonobos in the rainforests of the Congo.
The bonobos are along with chimpanzees, their closest relatives closest together.
That means we all share a common ancestor, a evolutionary grandmother that lived about six million years ago.
Now, the chimps are known for their <unk>
But unfortunately, we've done a lot of <unk> in this aspect in our narratives of human evolution.
But the bonobos show us the other side of the coin.
Whereas chimpanzees are dominated by big, <unk> society is in charge of females with power.
These guys have created something special -- because this leads to a very tolerant society, where violence is still not <unk>
But unfortunately, the bonobos are the least <unk> of the great apes.
They live in the depths of the rainforest <unk> and it's been very difficult to <unk>
Congo is a <unk> an extraordinary biodiversity of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty, but also the heart of the <unk> <unk> scenario that has been defined by decades and caused almost as many deaths as the First World War.
No wonder is that this destruction also puts up the survival of the <unk>
The trade of hunting meat and deforestation makes you not fill in or a stadium with the bonobos who have in the world -- and honestly, we are not quite sure.
However, in this land of violence and chaos can be heard of laughter hidden <unk> the trees.
Who are these <unk>
We know it as the apes <unk> love, not <unk> because they have sex <unk> <unk> and <unk> to handle conflict and solve social problems.
I'm not saying that this is the solution to all the problems of humanity because the life of Bonobos is more than <unk> <unk>
<unk> as humans, they love to play throughout their lifetime.
Play is not just a child game.
For us and for them the game is fundamental to establish links and foster <unk>
We learn to <unk> and we learn the rules of play.
The game increases creativity and resilience and has to do with the generation of <unk> diversity of interactions, diversity of behavior, diversity of connections.
And when you look at a Bonobo game sees the same <unk> roots of laughter, the dance and the human ritual,
The game is the glue that unites us.
I don't know how to play you, but I want to show you a couple of unique videos from the wild environment.
First, it's a <unk> style game, and I don't talk about football.
Here we have a female and a young male in the middle of a <unk>
Look at what's doing it.
Could it be the evolutionary origin of the phrase: <unk> it has <unk>
Just that I think in this case for him to him, right?
Yeah.
So sexual play is common as much in Bonobos as in humans.
And this video really is interesting because <unk> this video really is interesting because it shows the invention of bringing unusual elements into the game -- like the <unk> and also how the game needs trust and <unk> and at the same time is the most fun.
But play is <unk>
The game is <unk> it can take a lot of forms, some of which are more <unk> <unk> <unk> perhaps the place where wonder.
And I want you to <unk> this is <unk> a young female man, who is playing with water <unk>
I think, as it does, we sometimes play alone, and we explored the limits of our inner worlds and outside.
And it's that playful curiosity that drives us to explore, to explore, to interact. And then the unexpected connections that we form is the real <unk> of creativity.
These are just little samples from understanding that Bonobos give us our past and present.
But they also have a secret for our future, a future where we have to adapt to a increasingly difficult world with greater creativity and greater cooperation.
The secret is that play is the key to these abilities.
In other words, the game is our <unk> <unk>
To adapt to a world that changes we need to play.
But they will take the most of our own <unk>
The game is not <unk>
The game is essential.
For bonobos and humans -- it's not just cruel and <unk>
When it seems at least the least appropriate thing, they can be the moments when it is the most urgent thing.
And so fellow primates, we accept this gift of evolution and play together as <unk> creativity, friendship and wonder.
Thank you.
In New York City I'm responsible for a nonprofit organization called Robin <unk>
When I'm not fighting poverty, <unk> fires as a <unk> of captain in a body of firemen volunteers.
And in our city, where volunteers are dominating a highly skilled personnel one has to get to the site of the fire very soon to go into action.
I remember my first fire fire.
I was the second voluntary in the site, so I had a pretty high probability to go.
But there was still a race standing against the other volunteers to get to captain in charge and figure out what our work was.
When I found the <unk> I was <unk> in a conversation with the owner that certainly went through one of the worst days of his life.
We were at all night, she was standing outside in the rain, under a <unk> in her pajamas and <unk> while his house was on fire.
The other volunteer that I had just arrived before me, <unk> <unk> <unk> --  came up to the captain and he asked him to come up and would save the dog owner of the house.
The <unk> I was <unk> <unk>
There was a lawyer or a <unk> of money who, during the rest of his life, I would have to tell the people who walked into a building in a <unk> to save a live <unk> just because I won for five seconds.
Well, I was the following.
The captain made me a <unk>
He said, <unk> I need that between the house.
I need you to <unk> <unk> the fire, and he brings this woman a couple of shoes."
I <unk>
It wasn't exactly what I expected but <unk> I got up the stairs, at the end of the hall, I went to the fire department -- that that is the way to that much of the <unk> and they had just finished off the fire and walked into the main room for a pair of shoes.
I know what you're thinking, but I'm not a hero.
I took my load back through the ladder where I met my <unk> and the lovely dog in the front door.
<unk> from the house treasures for her house owner where, as I was to expect, his trove got much more attention than mine.
A few weeks later, the department received a letter from the house owner for the brave effort to save his house.
The kindness that she looked at over the other was that someone had ever reached a pair of shoes.
Both in my calling at Robin <unk> as in my calling as a voluntary fireman I'm witnessing the acts of generosity and kindness on a <unk> scale, but also acts of grace and courage to the individual level.
And you know what I've learned?
Everything has its importance.
So when I look at this room for people who've achieved, or are the <unk> levels of success I'd like to remind you this: not wait.
Don't wait to win the first million to make the difference in somebody's life.
If you have something to give, <unk> now.
<unk> food in a dining room, <unk> a <unk> park.
Be mentors.
Not every day we're going to have the opportunity to save the life of someone but every day we're going to be able to influence somebody's life.
So you trained the <unk> <unk> the shoes.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Mark, comes back.
Mark <unk> Thank you.
This may seem strange, but I'm a big fan of the concrete block.
The first concrete blocks they built in <unk> with a very simple idea, <unk> modules of a fixed measure that fit into each other.
Very quickly, these became the most used building unit in the world.
They have allowed us to build bigger things than us, like buildings or bridges -- a brick at the time.
Essentially, these blocks have become the pillars of our time.
Almost a hundred years later, in 1947, we came up with this.
It was called <unk> <unk>
And in a few years, the building blocks came to every home.
It's been estimated that they've made over 400 billion or 75 billion or 75 bricks on the planet.
You don't have to be an engineer to build beautiful buildings or home.
<unk> made it accessible.
<unk> simply adopted the block block -- the favorite in the world, and it became a fundamental piece of our imagination.
Meanwhile, exactly that same year, in the Bell labs, the next revolution was about to <unk> the new block of construction.
The transistor was a small plastic unit that would take us from a world of aesthetic bricks and piled on each other to a world where everything was interactive.
Just like the block block, the transistor allows to create very much bigger and more complex, a brick at the time.
But there's a <unk> difference. The transistor was just for experts.
I personally don't know it that the building blocks of our time are reserved to experts, so I decided to change it.
Eight years ago, when I was at the Media Lab, I started to explore the idea of bringing the power of engineers to the hands of artists and designers.
A few years ago, I started to develop <unk>
I'm going to show you how they work.
<unk> are electronics each with a specific function.
They're <unk> to be light, sound, engines and sensors.
And the best thing about everything is that they're attached by similarities.
So you can't put in the wrong way.
<unk> have a code of colors.
The green is the exit, the blue is the stream, the pink is the input and the orange color is the wire.
So you only have to assemble a blue blue and very quickly you can start to make bigger circuits.
A blue blue one with a green one produce light.
Can we put a button in the middle and we have a <unk>
If we change the button for a pulse, which is here, and now we have a <unk> light.
It <unk> this <unk> to create more impact and we have a noise.
I'm going to stop this.
So beyond the simple game, <unk> are actually very powerful.
Instead of having to program, connect and <unk> <unk> it allows us to program using very simple <unk>
To make it faster or slow down, you just get this button to make the pulse faster or slower.
The idea behind <unk> is that it's an increasing collection.
We want all the interactions in the world <unk> to bricks and ready to use.
<unk> sounds, solar panels, <unk> everything must be accessible.
We've given <unk> to the kids to see them playing with them.
And it's been an incredible experience.
The best thing is how they start to understand the electronics of every day you don't learn in schools.
For example, how a light at night, or why the door of an elevator is held open, or how an iPod responds to touch.
We've also taken <unk> to design schools.
So for example, designers without experience some electronics start to play with <unk> as a material.
Here you can see, with bottles of paper and <unk> we have <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk>  A a few weeks ago, we took <unk> to the designers of Rhode Island, that they have no experience in engineering, just in cardboard, wood and paper and said, Make something.
Here's an example of a project that has done, a <unk> <unk> <unk>
But wait, here's my favorite project.
It's a <unk> <unk> which is afraid of darkness.
For these these days, <unk> became another material, electronics became another material.
And we want this material.
And so, <unk> has open source.
You can visit the website, <unk> all the design files and <unk>
We want to encourage a world of creators, inventors and collaborators because this world in which we live, this interactive world is ours.
So I'm going ahead and things.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about the unexpected discoveries.
I work in the solar technology industry.
And my little company is looking to get involved with the environment in focusing on.
The distributed collaboration.
This is a little video of what we do.
<unk> Wait a moment.
You can take a little bit of <unk>
<unk> we can continue better we leave the video on one side.
No.
This is not ...
All right.
The solar technology is ...
Oh, I am like that.
All right. Thank you very much.
A couple of years ago I launched an initiative to recruit the best designers and technicians to take a year and work in an environment that represents almost everything that is supposed to be <unk> we asked them to work on government.
The initiative was called <unk> for <unk> and it would be like <unk> <unk>
<unk> some members every year and we put them to work with the <unk>
Instead of sending them to the Third World We send them the wild world.
They made great <unk> worked with the <unk>
Their task is to show the possibilities of technology today.
<unk> <unk>
This is a <unk> in Boston.
Here it appears as if I look at a quote, but what it really looks for is someone to clean up when it is caught up with the snow because he knows it's not very good by putting fires up when it's covered by a meter of snow.
How did it get to ask for help in this very <unk> way.
Last year in Boston we had a team of members of <unk> for <unk>
They were there in February and at that moment we would spend a lot last year.
They realized that the city never cleaned up these <unk>
But one of the members called Erik <unk> I noticed something else -- that the citizens who are <unk> with <unk> the sidewalks right in front of them.
So he did like any good programmer, I developed an app.
It's a nice application where you can take a <unk>
You accept <unk> when they <unk>
When you do that, you put a name, in this case he got <unk>
If you don't do it, someone can <unk>
I mean, it has a component uprising.
It's a modest application.
Maybe it's the smallest of the 21 applications last year.
But it does something that no other technology of the government <unk>
And it stretches in viral form.
A responsible system of <unk> City to see this app realized that I could use it -- not for the snow, but for citizens to get the <unk>
It's very important to work these <unk> of tsunami, but people <unk>
So he asks the citizens to <unk>
And then Seattle decided to use it to make the citizens <unk> the <unk> <unk>
And Chicago has just been <unk> to make people <unk> to clean sidewalks when they were.
So now we know nine cities that we would use to use it.
And this has been spread without <unk> in organic and natural ways.
If you know a little bit of government technology will know that this doesn't happen yet.
The acquisition of software usually takes a couple of years.
Last year in Boston we had a team working on a project that took three people for two and a half months.
It was a tool that parents could choose the best public school for their children.
Then they told us that they had done by normal channels that would have taken at least two years and side about two million dollars.
And that's nothing.
There is now a project in the California criminal power that even the time has to end over 2,000 million dollars and doesn't work.
And there's projects like this in every level of government.
So an app that has a couple of days in a couple of days and it spreads viral is a kind of warning warning to the institution of government.
It suggests the best ways to work, not as in private companies, as many people think it should be.
It's also not like a technological company, but rather as the Internet.
I mean, without <unk> in the open and <unk>
And that's important.
But the most important thing about this app is that it represents the way to address the question of the government that has the new <unk> not as a problem of an <unk> institution, but as a collective action problem.
And that's very good because it turns out we're very good for the collective action with digital technology.
And there is a very large community of people who are building the tools so that they were together with efficacy.
And it's not just <unk> for <unk> but there are hundreds of people around the country that contribute to <unk> applications every day in their own communities.
They have not been given to the government.
Do you feel a great frustration before that, but they don't get <unk>
And these people know something we've lost from view.
And it is that if we leave the feelings of politics, the line in the <unk> <unk> <unk> and all those other things that make us nuts, the government is essentially in the words of Tim <unk> "What we do together because they're not <unk>
Now, a lot of people have abandoned the government.
If you are one of those people, I would ask you to do it, because things are changing.
<unk> policy doesn't <unk> the government.
And because the government ultimately <unk> from -- remember that <unk> the <unk> the way to think about it will affect the way that change.
I didn't know a lot of government when I started with this.
And as a lot of people thought that the government was to choose people to be <unk>
Well, after two years I've come to the conclusion that the government is mostly about <unk>
This is the center of service for services and information.
It's the place that serves the calls if you mark <unk> in the U.S.
Scott <unk> this call.
He entered <unk> at the basis of official knowledge.
I found nothing. It started with animal control.
And he finally said, "Hey, you can open the doors of the house, put it very hard music and see if you were <unk>
And it worked. And so it worked.
But that wasn't the end of the <unk>
Boston is not a center of calls.
It has a <unk> and mobile application, called <unk> <unk>
You don't get that app.
It was the work of very clever people from the Office of New York City <unk> of Boston.
One day, this really happened to come up with this <unk> <unk> in my bucket of trash. I don't know if it's dead.
How do I do that for <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> is different.
Scott was talking in person.
In <unk> <unk> everything is public, so you all can see this.
In this case, it saw a neighbor.
The next report said, "I went to the place, I found the bucket of garbage behind the house.
<unk> Yeah. <unk> Yes.
I turned the <unk> I went home.
Good evening. <unk>
Quite simple.
This is great. It's the confluence of the digital and the physical thing.
And it's also a great example of the income for the government to the distributed volunteer collaboration.
But it's also a great example of government as a platform.
And here I don't necessarily mean the definition of national platform.
I'm talking about a platform for people to get married and help others.
So, a citizen helped another but here the government had a key role.
It connected to two people.
And it could have connected with government services to be necessary but the neighbor is a better alternative and cheaper than the government services.
When a neighbor helps each other, <unk> communities.
If we call control animals, it costs a lot of money.
One thing we need to think about the government is that it's not the same as politics.
A lot of people do it, but you think one is the entry of the other.
What our entry to the government system is the vote.
How many times have you chosen a <unk> <unk> sometimes we spend a lot of energy to choose a new political leader and then we hope that the government will support our values and we will embrace our needs but then we don't see changes.
That's because the government is like a massive ocean and politics is the surface of <unk>
below it is what we call <unk>
And we say that word with a lot of contempt.
But it's that <unk> which holds us that that has been in the fact that we funded as something that is happening in our against, that other thing, and as a result, we're losing power.
People believe that politics is sexy.
If we want this institution to work, we need to make it sexy.
Because it's where the real government works.
We have to collaborate with the machinery of government.
That makes the movement <unk>
They have <unk>
It's a group of citizens worried that they have written a very detailed report of <unk> pages in response to the order of the <unk> <unk> of <unk> on the financial reform project.
That's not political activism -- it's not political activism -- it's <unk>
And for the ones that we've been aware of the government, is time to ask ourselves what world we want to leave our children.
You have to see the huge challenges that they will have to face.
They really believe that we will get to where we need to go without solving the institution that can act on behalf of <unk>
We can't do without the government, we need to be more effective.
The good news is that with technology to be possible to rethink the root function of government so that it can expand <unk> to civil society.
There's a generation that grew up with the Internet and it knows that it's not so hard to act -- we just have to articulate the systems in the right way.
The average age of our members is 28 years old, so I am, to <unk> I'm a larger generation than many of them.
This is a generation that has grown up by taking the word and giving that almost for granted.
They're not giving that battle that we all face about who is going to be <unk> they're going to speak.
They can express their opinions in any channel at the same time and they do.
So when the government problem is that we don't care a lot to hear your voices.
They're using your hands.
They brought to the work to program applications that make better work better.
And those applications allow us to use the hands to improve our communities.
It can be cleaning up a <unk> by taking out <unk> dumping a bucket of garbage that has a <unk> in it.
Of course, we were always able to get cleaned up those <unk> and a lot of people do it.
But these applications are like digital <unk> that we're not only consumers, we're not only consumers of government that we pay and we get services.
We're more than that: we're citizens.
And we're not going to fix the government until we don't get the <unk>
So I want to ask everyone here, when it comes to the important things we have to do together, all together, we will be a crowd of voices, or we will also be a crowd of hands?
Thank you.
This is for me a real honor.
I've spent most of the time in prisons, prisons and death corridor of death.
I've spent the most part of my life in communities that are involved in projects and places where there's a lot of despair.
And I'm here at TED watching and hearing these <unk> has given me a lot of energy.
One of the things I've noticed in this short time, is that TED has identity.
And the things that are telling you here is impact around the world.
Sometimes if something comes from TED, it makes sense and a force that would not have a other way.
I say this because I think identity is <unk> important.
Here's fantastic presentations here.
And I think we've learned that the words of a teacher can have a lot of sense, but if you teach feeling with feeling, they can have a special meaning.
A doctor can do good things, <unk> if it's <unk> it can get a lot more.
So I want to talk about the power of identity.
I didn't really learn this in the practice of law, my job.
I learned it from my grandmother.
I grew up in a traditional house, dominated by a <unk> which was my grandmother.
It was hard, it was <unk>
It was the last word in all argument in the family.
She <unk> a lot of the <unk> in our home.
It was the daughter of people who had been slaves.
His parents were born in slavery in Virginia <unk>
She was born on the <unk> and his experience with <unk> <unk> the way it looked like the world.
She was hard, but it was also <unk>
When I was a little bit and looked at it, she was approaching me and give me a good hug.
I was so excited that I could barely breathe and then <unk>
One or two hours later, I would come back to <unk> and I said, <unk> you still feel my <unk>
And if I told him that no, I was going back again, and if I said yes, I was left in peace.
I had this human quality that I would always wish to be close to it.
The only problem is that I had 10 children.
My mother was the least of 10.
Sometimes when I was going to spend a time with her, it wasn't easy to take your time and your attention.
My cousins were running everywhere.
I remember when I was eight or nine years old, I woke up one morning, I went to the room and there were all my cousins.
My grandmother was on the other side of the room and looked at me <unk>
I thought I was a game.
And then he looked at him and she <unk> but she was very serious.
After 15 to 20 minutes, she got up through the room, and he took me out of his hand, and he said, "Come on. The two are going to <unk>
I remember this as if it was yesterday.
I'll never forget it.
He took me out and he said, <unk> I'll tell you something, but you can't say it to <unk>
I said, "Okay, <unk>
She said, "Now <unk> I didn't get it. I said, "Sure."
Then I sat down, he looked at me and said, "I want you to know that I've been <unk>
And <unk> <unk> that you're <unk>
He said, "I think you can do what you want.
I'll never forget it.
Then he said, "Just do I want you to do three things, <unk>
I said, <unk> <unk>
And he said, "I first want your mother."
<unk> <unk> is my <unk> and you have to <unk> that always <unk>
As I was <unk> to my mom, I said, "Yes, <unk> like this.
Then he said, "The second thing I want you to do, is that you're always going to do the right thing if the right thing is going to be <unk>
I thought I did, and I said, "Yes, <unk>
Then he finally said, "The third thing I want you to do is that I never have <unk>
I was nine years old, and I said, "Yes, <unk> like this.
I grew up in the field in South rural. I have a brother a year older and a sister a year.
When I was 14 -- 15, one day my brother came home with a package of six <unk> I don't know where the <unk> took us to my sister and me and we went to the forest.
We just arrived at the <unk> of the time.
He took a sip of beer, he offered her sister, she took a little bit and offered me to me.
I said, "No, no, no. It's okay. You know, but I'm not going to take <unk>
My brother said, <unk> <unk> <unk> and you always do the same thing that we do.
I already took something, your sister as well.
I said, "No, I wouldn't feel good. You can <unk>
Then my brother looked at me.
And he said, "What happens? Take a <unk>
I went into the <unk> and <unk> "Ah, it won't be you thinking about the conversation with <unk>
I said, "But what are you talking about?"
He said, <unk> tells you all the grandchildren that are <unk>
I was <unk>
I have to admit something to you.
I'll tell you something that probably shouldn't say.
I know this will spread <unk>
But I have 52 years old, and I can admit that I've never taken a drop of alcohol.
I don't say this thinking that's a <unk> I mean by the power that has the identity.
When we create the right type of identity, we say things to others that they really don't make sense.
We can't get them to do things that they don't believe being able to do.
I think my grandmother naturally believed that all of their grandchildren were special.
My grandfather had been a prisoner during the <unk>
My uncles died of diseases related to alcohol.
And these were the things that, according to it, we should have <unk>
Now, I'll try to talk about our criminal justice system.
This country is very different than it was 40 years ago.
In <unk> there were 300,000 prisoners.
There are 2.3 million.
In America we have the largest incarceration rate in the world.
We have seven million people in parole.
And this massive incarceration in my opinion, has fundamentally changed our world.
In poor communities or black or black, you find so much <unk> so determined by these facts.
One of every three black men between the 18 and the 30 years is in jail or <unk>
In the urban <unk> of all the country, Los Angeles, Baltimore, Washington, 50 to 60 percent of all the young people are in prison or <unk>
Our system is not just distorted in front of race, it's also about poverty.
In this country we have a court system that makes you much better if you're rich and guilty.
It's not <unk> but wealth that affects the results.
And it seems to be very <unk>
The politics of fear and anger make us believe that these are not a problem with ours.
We're <unk>
It seems interesting.
We're looking at our work with some more curious developments as well.
In my state, in Alabama, as well as in other states, you care about the rights for always if you have a criminal crime.
Right now, in Alabama, the <unk> of black male population has definitely lost the right to vote.
And if we projected it to the next 10 years, the level of the loss of rights will be as high as it was before the law of the right to vote.
We have this awesome silence.
I represent children.
A lot of my customers are very young.
America is the only country in the world where they was sentence at 13 years to die in prison.
We have in this country prison for children, no chance of getting out there.
Now we are in the process of some <unk>
The only country in the world.
They were to people in the death row
This issue of death penalty is interesting.
In a sense, you have to think that the final question is, people deserve to die by the <unk> <unk>
A very sensitive question.
But you can think of another way about how we are in our identity.
There's another way of <unk> it is not about deciding whether people deserve to die from the <unk> but if we deserve to kill.
This is interesting.
death penalty in America is defined by mistake.
From every nine <unk> people has identified one which is innocent and liberated from death row, of death.
A <unk> rate <unk> an innocent one of nine.
This is interesting.
In aviation it would never allow you to fly airplanes if every nine that you would have, you would have <unk>
But somehow we get rid of the problem.
It's not our problem.
It's not our charge.
It's not our fight.
I talk a lot about these things.
I'm talking about race and this issue of whether we deserve to kill.
It is interesting that in my classes with students on <unk> history, I talk about slavery, I talk about slavery.
I talk to you about terrorism, the time started at the end of the rebuilding and that for the Second World War.
Really, we don't know a lot about this.
But for black Americans in this country, it was a defined time by terror.
In many communities people were afraid of being <unk>
They were worried to be <unk>
The threat of terror was what defined their lives.
Now there are older people who come to me and say, "Mr. Stevenson, you might say <unk> <unk> <unk> people who stop saying that in our history we deal with the terrorism, after the <unk>
They ask me to say, "No. Say we grew up with that."
The era of terrorism went on, obviously, with <unk> and decades of telling race and separation.
In this country we have a dynamic where we don't like to talk about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our history.
And that's why we haven't understood the meaning of what we've historically done.
All of the time you get to each other.
We were constantly creating tensions and conflict.
It costs me to work to talk about races. I think it's because we're not willing to engage with a process of truth and reconciliation.
In South Africa, people understood that they couldn't overcome racial segregation without a commitment to truth and reconciliation.
In Rwanda, even before the genocide had this commitment, but in this country we haven't done it.
I was in Germany giving talks about death.
It was fascinating because one of the teachers stood after my presentation and said, "You know, it's well worrying to listen to what they would expect.
<unk> "We don't have a death penalty in Germany.
<unk> we will never be there.
The room was silent, and a lady said, "There's no way that we have our history, we could never get into the systematic death of human beings.
It would be irrational that we <unk> <unk> and <unk> we would put us to run the people."
Do you think about this.
How would we feel in a world where a nation like Germany, <unk> people, especially if they were in their most <unk>
We couldn't get it.
It would be irrational.
And yet, there is this disconnection.
I think our identity is in danger.
If we don't really care about these issues, the positive things and wonderful things are, however, <unk>
We love innovation.
We are fascinated by technology. <unk> creativity.
We love entertainment.
But now, those realities are <unk> by suffering, the abuse, the <unk> the <unk>
In my opinion, it takes to integrate both things.
We're talking about the need to have more hope, higher commitment, more <unk> to the basic challenges of the life of this complex world.
I think that means spending more time thinking and talking about the poor, the <unk> that will never come to TED.
If you think about them is, in some ways, something that's within our self.
It's true that we have to believe in issues that we haven't seen.
So we are, despite being so rational, so deeply committed to the <unk>
With innovation, the development is not just about brain ideas.
These things come from <unk> ideas, also by the convictions of the heart.
This connection of your mind with the heart is what drives us to look at not only the brilliant and <unk> but in the dark and the hard thing.
<unk> <unk> the great <unk> leader talked about this.
He said, "When we were in East Europe, suffering the <unk> we wanted all sorts of things, but mostly what we needed was hope, the orientation for the spirit, a will for being in places of despair and being <unk>
Well, that orientation for the spirit is pretty much in the heart of what I think even in communities like TED, must be <unk>
There is no disconnect related to technology and design, which allows us to be truly human if we don't pay attention to poverty, and we don't pay attention to inequality, injustice.
Now I want to warn you, that these thoughts make up a much more challenging identity than if we present these things.
We go back to <unk>
I had the big privilege, being a very young lawyer to meet Rosa <unk>
These women were getting together just to speak.
Occasionally, Mrs. <unk> called me to say, <unk> comes the Mrs. <unk> We're going to bring together to speak.
Do you want to come and do it.
I said, "I know lady. I do."
Then she said, "Well, what are you going to do when you <unk>
<unk> <unk>
So I was going and just <unk>
It was very <unk> very <unk>
And on one occasion, I was there listening to these <unk> and after a couple of hours, Ms. Parks led to me and said, "Now, <unk> tell me that it's that idea of justice justice.
Tell me what you're trying to do."
And I started to give him my speech.
I said, "Well, we're trying to question the injustice.
We try to help those who have been convicted of <unk>
We try to confront the biases and discrimination in the management of criminal justice.
We try to end up with the death sentences for life, without freedom for children.
We try to do something about death.
We try to reduce the population in prisons.
We try to end the <unk> <unk>
I gave her all my best speech, and he looked at me and said, <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> <unk> <unk> very <unk>
At that moment, Mrs. <unk> got my finger on the face and said, "This is why you have to be very <unk>
I think actually, the TED community has to be much more <unk>
We need to find the way to address those challenges, those issues, that <unk>
Because ultimately humanity depends on compassion for others.
I've learned some very simple things in my work.
I've been <unk> in simple things.
I've come to understand and believe that each of us is higher to the worst of us that we have <unk>
I think that's true for everybody on the planet.
I'm convinced that if someone says a lie, it's not because it's a liar.
I'm sure if someone takes something that doesn't belong to you, it's not that it's a <unk>
Even, if someone kills another, it's not that it's a <unk>
This is why I think there's a basic dignity in the people who must be <unk> by law.
I also believe that in many parts of this country and certainly in many parts of the world, the opposite of poverty is not the wealth.
That's how it isn't.
I really think that in many parts of the global poverty is justice.
And finally, I think that even though it's very beautiful, very <unk> very <unk> it doesn't happen to us by our technology, by our design, or our intellectual and rational.
At the end of the end of a society, not by the way they deal with the rich and powerful people, but because of the way they treat the poor, the <unk> the prisoners.
Because it's in this context as we started to understand truly deep issues about what we are.
Sometimes I feel <unk> I'm going to end up with a story.
Sometimes I do too much force.
<unk> tired, like everybody.
Sometimes those ideas go beyond my <unk> in a major way.
I've been representing these guys who have been <unk> with a lot of <unk>
I'm going to jail and I see my customers of 13 and 14 years old, who have been <unk> to be told as adults as adults.
And I start thinking, how can it be?
How can a judge a judge will turn someone in what isn't it?
The judge was <unk> as an adult, but I see a child.
A very late evening I was awake -- my God, if the judge can turn you into something that you don't are, must have magical powers.
Yes, <unk> the judge has magical powers.
You should ask something about that.
As it was too late, I couldn't think right, but I started working on a <unk>
I had a 14 year-old teacher, black <unk>
I started working on <unk> with a <unk> who said, <unk> so that my <unk> black client is treated as a privileged <unk> of 75 years executive from a <unk>
In <unk> I put there there had been <unk> conduct in the <unk> in the behavior of the police and in the process.
There was a <unk> line on how in this country there is no ethical -- but a whole lack of ethics.
The next morning, I woke up thinking that <unk> <unk> would be a dream, or really the <unk>
For my horror, I had not only had it, but I had sent it to the court.
It took about two months, I had forgotten it.
And finally <unk> Oh God, I have to go to cut this case stupid.
I got into the car and I was truly <unk> <unk>
I went in the car to court.
I thought this would be very difficult and <unk>
I finally came down from the car. He walks to court.
I was going up the stairs when I met with a black man -- was the <unk> of court.
When he saw me, he came up to me and said, "Who is you?"
I said, "I'm a <unk> He's a <unk> He's <unk> I said yes.
And then I came up and <unk>
And I was focusing on the ear.
He said, "I'm proud of <unk>
I have to tell you now that that was <unk>
That was deeply connected with my interior, with my identity that we all have to contribute to the community with a vision of hope.
Well, I went to the hall.
When we walked in, the judge saw me.
And he said, "Mr. Stevenson, you wrote this audacity <unk>
I said, "I know Mr. <unk> And we started going forward.
People started there. They were all <unk>
I was the one that had written those <unk>
And the policemen got the prosecutors <unk> the <unk>
Suddenly, without knowing how, the room was full of people, and all luckily because we talked about races, because we talked about poverty, because we talked about inequality.
With the <unk> of the eye, I got to see the <unk> which was going and <unk>
I would look out the window and try to hear all that <unk>
<unk> walking over here and there.
Finally, this old black black, and I went into the room and sat behind me, almost at the table of lawyers.
About 10 minutes later, the judge would take a <unk>
During the break a <unk> <unk> he showed you, because the <unk> had come in the room.
The assistant <unk> over old black.
And he said, <unk> what do you do in the <unk> room.
And the old black man stood up and looked at the <unk> and he looked at me and said, <unk> to this young audiences to tell this young man who would maintain his view in the goal with <unk>
I have come today to TED because I think many of you understand that the moral arc of the universe is very big, but it folds into justice.
That we cannot be truly human <unk> if we don't care about human rights and for dignity.
That our survival is linked to others.
What our visions of technology, design and creativity and creativity is to <unk> <unk> and justice.
And above all, to those of you who share this, I just want to tell you to keep your view in the goal with <unk>
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Talk to hear and see a very obvious desire for the audience, of this community, to help in your purposes, and doing something.
Something that isn't a check. What can we do?
<unk> There are several opportunities close to.
If you live in the state of California, for example, there will be a <unk> this spring in which it's going to make an effort to get the funding that is spent in today's policies.
For example, here in California, you're going to spend a billion dollars in death row, in the next five years, a billion dollars.
And despite this, the <unk> of <unk> cases not <unk> in <unk>
The <unk> of rapes don't get to nothing.
Here's an opportunity for change.
This <unk> is going to propose that these funds are going to make the law of the law to safety.
I think there's a very close opportunity.
CA: There's been a huge decline in the <unk> in the United States, in the last three decades.
Part of the explanation, it says that it has to do with the highest rate of <unk>
What would you say to what you think is that?
<unk> Actually, the rate of <unk> with violence has remained relatively stable.
The big growth in mass <unk> in this country is not for crimes with violence.
It's by the wrong war against drugs.
That's why it emerges this dramatic increase in the <unk> population.
And we let us convince the rhetoric of this punishment.
We have three legal causes. We have three legal causes to bring people into the chain of <unk> to steal a bicycle, by small crimes against the property, rather than making it <unk> those resources to their victims.
I think we need to do more to help the victims of <unk> and not less.
It seems to me that our current philosophy of punishment does nothing for anybody.
I think that's the orientation that has to change.
CA: <unk> have you excited about here today.
You're very inspiring.
Thank you very much for having come to TED. Thank you.

Peter <unk> These are just some of the clips I got in the last six months -- <unk> could be over the last six days or the last six years.
The idea is that media means <unk> negative news -- because our minds pay attention to them.
And that answers to a very good reason.
In every second of our senses our senses are getting a lot more data than probably the brain can be <unk>
And as nothing we care more than survive, the first stop of all of those data is an ancient piece of the temporal lobe called <unk>
The amygdala is our early warning detector, the detector.
<unk> and recorded all the information for something in the environment that could make us hurt.
So for that of a <unk> stories, looking at the <unk>
That old adage of <unk> "If there is blood, <unk> is very true.
And given that all digital devices give us negative news give us the seven days of the week, 24 hours a day, not wonder that we are <unk>
It's not surprising that people think that the world is going to be wrong with worse.
But maybe it's not like that.
Maybe what really happens is that we got <unk>
Perhaps enormous progress done in the last century by a series of forces is <unk> so we have the potential to create a world of abundance in the next three decades.
I'm not saying that we don't have our good problems: climate change, the extinction of species, the scarcity of water and <unk> without doubt we have.
As human beings are very good at <unk> the problems and, in the long time, we just had them.
<unk> then what happened in the last century to see where we go.
Over the last hundred years, the average of life has been more than <unk> the average income per capita income has <unk> around the world.
Child mortality has reduced 10 times.
In addition, the cost of food food, of transportation and communications, has fallen from 10 to 1,000 times.
Steve <unk> showed us that we're living the most peaceful time of human history.
And Charles <unk> that global literacy is 25 percent to more than 80 percent in the last 130 years.
We're really living an extraordinary time.
A lot of people do it.
And we continue to get more and higher expectations.
In fact, we would make meaning of poverty.
<unk> today in America, much of the people who live under the line of poverty have electricity, water, toilets, <unk> TV, air conditioning and cars.
The <unk> <unk> of the last century, the <unk> on the planet, would never have dreamed of such a <unk>
It is a lot of technology and the technology -- exponential growth.
My good friend Ray Kurzweil showed that any tool that <unk> on information technology jumps on this curve, Moore's Law, and doubling the performance of price in about 12 to 24 months.
So the mobile phone that you have in your pocket is a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a supercomputer in the '70s.
Now look at this curve.
It's Moore's Law for the last hundred years.
So I want you to look at two things on this curve.
First, the soft thing that is -- in good time and bad time, in the war and peace, in recession and <unk>
It's the resulting computers that used to build a faster computers.
It doesn't stop at any of the big challenges.
And although there's a law on the left, the curve goes up up.
The growth rate of technology is more and faster.
And in this curve, to <unk> from Moore's Law, there is a series of extraordinarily powerful technologies that we have.
The computation in the cloud, that my friends of <unk> call infinite computing, sensors and networks, the robotics, 3D printing and their ability to democratize personalized production on all the planet, and synthetic biology, the emissions and the food, the digital medicine and the digital medicine <unk> and <unk>
I mean, how many you saw the victory on Watson, <unk>
It was <unk>
I was looking for the newspapers the best headline than <unk>
And I loved this: <unk> <unk> <unk>
"Jeopardy" is not a easy game.
He plays with the <unk> of human language.
Imagine this artificial intelligence in the cloud, available for all of the mobile phone.
Four years ago, here at TED, Ray Kurzweil and I, we launched a new university called <unk> <unk>
We teach them these technologies to our students, and in particular, how can you be used to solve the great challenges of humanity.
And every year we asked them to release a company, or a product or service that can be positively <unk> the lives of a billion people in a decade.
Think about that, the fact that a group of students today can impact a billion people.
Thirty years ago, that would have <unk> absurd.
Today we can point out a <unk> of companies that have already done.
When I think about creating abundance, it doesn't mean to create life <unk> for every single <unk> is about creating a life of it.
It's about taking that that it's scarce and making it <unk>
You see, scarcity is <unk> and technology is a force that releases resources.
I'll give you an example.
It's a story of Napoleon <unk> in the <unk>
He's the guy on the left.
<unk> the king of <unk>
The troops from Napoleon ate <unk> of silver, and the same <unk> with gold <unk>
But the king of <unk> ate <unk>
You see, aluminum was the most valuable metal of the planet, was worth more than gold and <unk>
That's why the tip of the Washington center is aluminum <unk>
You see, although aluminum is the <unk> of the mass of the Earth, it doesn't come like pure metal metal anymore.
It's tied for oxygen and <unk>
But then he got the <unk> and made of aluminum something so cheap that we use it as if it was <unk>
It was <unk> this analogy to the future.
Let's think about energy scarcity.
Ladies and gentlemen, we are on a planet that are <unk> by 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year.
They get to the Earth 16 <unk> of energy every <unk> minutes.
It's not about it, it's about <unk>
And there's good news.
This year, for the first time, the cost of solar power in India is 50 percent less than the generated by <unk> <unk> rupees versus 17 rupees.
The cost of solar energy fell 50 percent last year.
Last month, MIT published a study that shows that in the end of the decade, in the U.S. parts of the United States, solar electricity will cost six cents an hour compared to 15 cents in the national average.
And if we have a abundance of energy abundance we have also abundance of water.
Let's talk about the water for water.
Remember when Carl Sagan pointed out the Voyager spacecraft to the Earth, in 1990, after he passed away.
<unk> a famous photo, how do you <unk>
"A <unk> <unk>
Because we live on a planet of water.
We live on a planet covered in 70 percent of water.
Yes, the <unk> is saltwater, saltwater, two percent is ice, and we fought for the water <unk> of the planet, but there's also a hope.
It's a technology available not in 10 or 20 years, but right now.
It comes the nanotechnology, the <unk>
In a conversation with Dean Kamen this morning, one of the innovators in the <unk> I'd like to share with you with you, gave me permission to <unk> his technology called <unk> <unk> the <unk> is the size of a small refrigerator refrigerator already.
It is able to generate a thousand liters of drinking water to the day of any metal source, saltwater, contaminated water, for less than two cents a gallon.
President of Coke has just thought that I'm going to make a major test of hundreds of these units in the developing world.
If that comes out, and I have full confidence in which this is how it will be, Coca-Cola is going to do it in <unk> countries on the planet.
This is an <unk> innovation for this technology that today.
And we've seen it on mobile phones.
My God, we're going to get to 70 percent penetration in the developing world for the end of 2013.
It was going to give you that <unk> warrior has better mobile communications communications in Kenya that President Reagan 25 years ago.
And with a smart cell with Google, it has access to more knowledge and information that President Clinton is 15 years ago.
It lives in a world of abundance of information and communications that nobody could have predicted before.
So better than that, the things that you and I have paid dozens and hundreds of thousands of dollars -- <unk> video libraries and music and music technology, technology -- now <unk> and lose value of market with mobile phones.
Maybe the best thing gets the best to get in your health.
Last month, I had the pleasure to announce with the <unk> Foundation, something called the X X <unk> <unk>
We're challenging the teams of the world to make these technologies into a mobile device that they talk about, and because they have <unk> they can be able to get blood from your finger.
To win it has to make better diagnoses than a certificate.
Imagine this device in the middle of the developing world where there is no doctors, where the burden of <unk> is 25 percent and there are <unk> of health workers.
When this device <unk> a <unk> virus or DNA that I don't want to call the health care and, first of all, avoiding the pandemic.
But this is the biggest force of producing a world of abundance.
I call it the <unk>
The white lines here are the population.
We just had a brand of <unk> billion.
By the way, the best protection of the population is to provide the world of education and health.
In 2010, we had less than two billion people online, connected.
By 2020, it'll come from two billion to five billion people on the Internet.
Three billion minds never before <unk> to the global conversation.
What will these people?
What <unk> What would you say?
And instead of economic collapse, we will have the largest economic injection of history.
These people represent tens of trillion dollars in the global economy.
And <unk> health care thanks to the <unk> of a better education with the Khan Academy of <unk> and because of using 3D impressions and computing in the cloud will be more productive than ever before.
What can we give us 3,000 billion more members of humanity, healthy educated and <unk>
How about voices never before <unk>
What if we give them to the oppressed. wherever they are, a voice to be heard and be able to act for the first time?
What did these 3,000 billion?
And if they are contributions we can't <unk>
One thing that I learned with the X Prize is that small, guided by his passion with one of course, they can do things -- things that could only do the big corporations and the governments.
I'm going to finish by sharing a story that really bothers me.
There's a program that probably some heard of.
It's called <unk>
<unk> at University of Washington, in Seattle.
It's a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids and figure out how to fold up the protein.
<unk> determine the structure and the functionality.
It's very important in medical research.
And so far, it was a problem of <unk>
They've played with this, university professors, among others.
Then hundreds of thousands of people came together and started <unk>
And it has shown today the machinery of pattern recognition machinery is better folding proteins than the best computers.
Ladies and gentlemen, what gives me a huge confidence in the future is that we have more power as people to take the big challenges on the planet.
We have the tools with this exponential technology.
We have the passion of the <unk> of <unk>
We have the capital of <unk>
And we have three billion new minds that are committed to us to work on the solution of great challenges and doing what we should do.
We have in front of a few decades of decades.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about a very <unk> idea.
<unk> <unk>
And as the idea can be explained in a minute, I will give you three examples to do time.
The first story is Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
He was here, as you know, in <unk>
Maybe they believed that <unk> <unk> but it didn't.
It actually <unk> fish.
And he described one of them as a very <unk>
It was the <unk>
He caught it a lot up to the decade of <unk>
Now the fish is in the Red Cross <unk>
But we've heard this story a lot of times, in the Galapagos and other places, so that has no special of it.
But the case is that we still come to the Galapagos.
We still think they're <unk>
The brochures still say they are still <unk>
So what happens here?
Second story, also illustrates another concept, the shift of the waist.
Because I was there in <unk> studying one in West Africa.
I was there because I grew up in Europe and then wanted to work in Africa.
I thought I could <unk>
I burned a lot with the sun and I was convinced I was not there.
This is my first exhibition to the sun.
The lagoon was surrounded by <unk> and as you can see, about <unk>
There were <unk> of about 20 inch -- the black beard, <unk>
And the fishery of this <unk> was very abundant and spent for a good moment, so he was made more than a half in Ghana.
When I went there 27 years later, the number of fish had dropped in half.
I went to the five inches.
They would have a genetic pressure.
There were still fish.
In a way, they were still happy.
And the fish were still happy to be there.
I mean, nothing to changed, but everything has changed.
My third story is that I was complicit in the introduction of <unk> in Southeast Asia.
In the 1970s <unk> it started in <unk> Europe did a lot of development projects.
The fishing development was to impose to the countries that were already <unk> <unk> <unk> industrial fishing.
And this boat is pretty ugly, <unk> <unk>
I went out to fish on it, and we did studies in the southern China Sea and especially in the Beaufort Sea.
What we captured we captured was something <unk>
<unk> now, the bottom of the sea.
Ninety percent of what we captured were <unk> other animals that are on the background.
And most of the fish are <unk> tiny little bit of the remains of coral reef <unk>
In short, the bottom of the sea came to the deck and then it was <unk>
These images are extraordinary because the transition is very quick.
In a year, you do a study and then you start commercial fishing.
The bottom fund is going to be a solid coral background in this case, to be a <unk>
This is a dead <unk>
They were not <unk> <unk> because they were dead.
Once we captured a alive.
I wasn't <unk>
So they wanted to <unk> because it was a good food.
This mountain of remains is what we collect the fishermen every time they go to an area where they've never fish.
But there's no <unk>
<unk> the world, but we don't remember.
They would get the start to start -- the new level, without remembering what was there.
If you look at this something like this.
On the x-axis, we have <unk> biodiversity, number of <unk> the <unk> of the country, the water supply.
And that changes over time. It changes because people do things with <unk>
Every generation will use <unk> images at the beginning of their conscious life as normal, and they extrapolate it forward.
The difference is they perceive loss.
But they don't perceive the loss that happened before.
You can look at the model of changes.
And at the end of it to keep a few <unk> remains.
And that, in great extent, we want to do it now.
We want to keep things that they don't are, or they're not what they were.
But you should think that this problem affects people when societies, killing animals without knowing what they've done to some generations later.
Because obviously, an animal that is very plentiful, before <unk> is <unk>
You don't lose animals.
You lose a little bit common.
Even if this is not perceived as a big loss.
Over time, we focus on the big animals, and in a small sea of big fish.
They become <unk> because <unk>
Over time, there's a few fish, but we think that's the point of <unk>
And the question is, why do we accept this?
Well, because we don't know it was different.
In fact, a lot of people, scientists, <unk> that was very different.
And they will do it because the evidence was presented in a previous way that they would expect that they have evidence.
For example, the anecdote that some <unk> as Captain as Captain and just looked at a lot of fish in this area that can't be used or generally not use the scientists in the fishing <unk> because it's not <unk>
So we have a situation where people don't know the past, even though we lived in <unk> societies, because they don't trust the sources of the past.
From there the enormous role that can be turned into a protected <unk>
Because with the marine <unk> we actually visualize the past.
<unk> the past that people can't think of because the starting point is run and it's incredibly low.
That's for the people who can see a protected protected area and they can benefit from the vision that they would do, which allows them to erase their point of <unk>
And what about the people who can't do it because they have no access, like the people in the Midwest, for example?
I think the arts and cinema might be able to fill the vacuum.
This is a simulation of the Bay Bay.
A long time ago, there was gray whales in <unk> Bay 500 years ago.
And you may have noticed that the <unk> and the <unk> are like <unk>
And if you think about <unk> if you think about why people were moved with the film <unk> to talk about the story of <unk> why are we talking about <unk>
Because it raises something that, in some sense, has been lost.
So my <unk> the only one to giving, is Cameron, we can get <unk> <unk> under the water.
Thank you very much.
Hello. I'm Kevin <unk> the <unk> tendencies of <unk> and I look at YouTube YouTube video.
It's true.
So today, we will see why videos are <unk> and what importance has that.
We all want to be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> When I was younger, that seemed very, very hard.
But today, the web video makes any of us, or our actions, come together in a part of our global culture.
Anyone can do it famous on the Internet in a <unk>
You go over 48 hours of video to YouTube for a minute.
And of those, only one small percentage is viral gets lots of <unk> and wins <unk>
How does that happen?
Three things: creators of trends, and a surprise.
Well, <unk>
<unk> <unk> Oh, my God, my God.
Oh my God!
Wow.
<unk> <unk>
KA: Last year, <unk> <unk> published this video shot outside his house in the National Park of <unk>
In 2010, it was 23 million times.
This graph shows the views in the rise of last summer.
<unk> didn't say to make a viral video.
I just wanted to share a <unk> <unk>
That's what you do when Mountain <unk>
There were already published many videos of nature.
This video was published in January.
So what happened here?
He was Jimmy <unk>
Jimmy <unk> ran this idea to <unk> the <unk>
The creators of trends like Jimmy <unk> present things and interesting things and <unk> to a wider audience.
Rebecca <unk>  He's on a Friday.   You all want to start on Friday.   Everybody wants to get a week, a weekend.    <unk> Friday. <unk> on Friday.  KA: Wouldn't you think that we could have this conversation without talking about this video, I hope.
It's one of the most popular videos of the year.
You saw it almost 200 million times this year.
This graph shows the frequency of use.
Just like <unk> <unk> this video seemed to come from the nothing.
So what happened this happened?
Well, it was Friday, it's true.
And if you ask for those other <unk> they are also Friday.
But what happened this day in particular <unk>
Well, it took them <unk> and many blogs started writing about it.
Michael J. <unk> of <unk> Science was one of the first people to do a joke about the video on Twitter.
But what's important is that one person or a group of creators trends embrace a view of view and share with a broader audience, accelerating the process.
So, this community of people who shares this big joke behind the inner joke -- then it starts to talk about that and do things.
And now there are 10,000 <unk> <unk> on YouTube.
Just in the first seven days, there was a parody for each other days.
Unlike the 20th century, the 20th century, this communal participation is our way to be part of the <unk> phenomenon, or doing something new with <unk>
<unk> <unk> is an <unk> animation with an <unk> music.
That's the whole thing.
This year was about 50 million times.
And if you think that's rare, you know that there's a version of three hours that has seen four million times.
So even the cats saw this video.
And there are cats that saw other cats see the video.
But the important thing here is the creativity that woke up between the Internet <unk> community.
There was <unk>
Somebody did a version of the old one.
And then it became international <unk>
Suddenly, a whole community of <unk> who made this happen from being a joke stupid to something that we can all be part of.
Because today not just <unk> <unk>
Who could have predicted something like this?
Who could have predicted <unk> <unk> or RS: Black or <unk> <unk>
What do the script might have been written by this situation?
In a world where two days of video are going up for minute, only that really unexpected and unexpected thing can be made of the way that these things have done.
When a friend told me that I had to see this great video of a kind that <unk> protest against <unk> in New York, I admit that I didn't really interested in too much.
Casey Casey <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> but often there are some obstacles that keep you around the <unk> of the <unk>
KA: Thank you a surprise and to its humor, Casey Casey <unk> I was able to get five million watched and understand their idea.
So this approach is worth all of the new things that we do.
And all of this leads to a great question.
<unk> <unk> What does this mean?
<unk>
KA: What does this mean?
The creators of trend for creative communities of participation, the totally unexpected, are features of a new kind of media -- where we all have access and is the audience that defines the popularity
As I said earlier, one of the current celebrities of the world, Justin Justin began on YouTube.
Don't give permission to express your ideas.
Now we're all a <unk> of our pop culture.
These are not the characteristics of the old media characteristics -- they are just the current media -- but we will have the entertainment of the future.
Thank you.
This is not a <unk> story.
It's a puzzle that's still <unk>
Let me tell you about some of the parts.
Imagine the first <unk> a man burning the work of a whole life.
It's a poet, a <unk> a man whose entire life had been supported by the only unit and freedom of his country.
<unk> as the <unk> come into <unk> <unk> the fact that their life had been totally in vain.
The words for so much time friends, now we would get it.
They become silence.
He died broken by history.
He's my grandfather.
I never met him.
But our lives are much more than our memories.
My grandmother never allowed me to forget his story.
My task was not to let that have been in <unk> and my lesson was to learn that the story tried to be <unk> but it was <unk>
The next part of the puzzle is about a boat to dawn <unk> <unk> into the sea.
My mother, <unk> was only 18 years old when his father died, and a <unk> marriage and two little girl children.
For her, life had been destined for a task to <unk> the escape from his family and a new life in Australia.
It was <unk> for her that I couldn't do that.
And after a <unk> four years that challenges the fiction, a boat corresponds to the sea dressed up to the hot sea of it.
All the adults knew the risks.
The biggest fear was the bonds and the death.
As most of the adults, my mother had a <unk> with poison.
If we were <unk> we would take my sister and I, and then she and my grandmother.
My first memories are from that boat, the constant rhythm of the motor, the <unk> <unk> in every wave, and the vast and empty horizon, <unk>
I don't remember hackers who came up several times, but they were <unk> with the courage of men in our boat, or the breathing engine and not to be able to start for six hours.
But I can remember the lights of the oil platform in front of the coast of Malaysia, and the young man who collapsed and died, finish the journey was too <unk> and the first apple that I did, given for the men on the platform.
No apple had the same flavor.
After three months in a refugee camp, <unk> in <unk>
And the next piece of the puzzle is about four women over three generations giving a new life together.
We set up in <unk> a <unk> suburb of <unk> whose population is comprised of immigrants there.
Unlike the <unk> unlike the middle class, whose existence was <unk> in <unk> there was no sense of right.
The smells that came from shops were the rest of the world.
And the fragments of English was <unk> between people who had one thing in common: they were starting again.
My mother worked in farms, then in a car assembly line, working six days, <unk>
Yet, I found time to study English and get a title in IT in the <unk>
We were poor.
All of the dollars were <unk> and they got an extra <unk> in English and mathematics, they wouldn't mind what was supposed to be <unk> which was usually clothes, and he was always <unk>
Two base pairs for school, one to hide the holes in the other.
A school uniform uniform to <unk> because I had to last six years.
And there was weird <unk> and <unk> on the <unk> <unk> and some <unk> <unk> go back home."
Where are we home, where?
One of me are <unk>
I was accumulating <unk> and a voice that said, "I'm going to <unk>
My mother, my sister and I <unk> in the same bed.
My mother was <unk> every night, but we were excited about our day and <unk> the movements of our grandmother at home.
My mother was suffering from the ship.
And my task was to be awake until his nightmares started to be able to be <unk>
She opened a computer store, and then I studied to be <unk> and opened another business.
And the women would come with their stories about men who couldn't do the transition and angry and <unk> and boys are trapped between two worlds.
They were looked at subsidies and <unk>
And they created centers.
I lived in parallel worlds.
In one, I was the classic classical student, relentless with what I would find out of myself.
On the other one, I was <unk> in <unk> lives of violence, drug abuse and <unk>
But many of them got help through the years.
And for that work, when I was studying my last year -- I was elected by the young fall of the year.
And I was <unk> from a piece of the puzzle to the other, but its edges didn't <unk>
So <unk> <unk> <unk> was now as <unk> refugee and social activist who was invited to talk in places that I had never heard of, and in houses whose existence would never be imagined.
I didn't know the <unk>
I didn't know how to use the <unk>
I didn't know how to talk about wine.
I didn't know how to talk about anything.
I wanted to retreat to the routines. And the comfort of life in a <unk> <unk> -- a grandmother, a mother and two daughters end the day as they did for almost 20 years, <unk> on the day of each and <unk> <unk> the three in the same bed.
And I told my mom that I couldn't do it.
It reminded me that I was now the same age that she had when we got into the ship.
The "no" had never been an option.
<unk> he said, "What is not going to be <unk>
So I talked about <unk> juvenile and education and <unk> to the marginalized and the <unk>
And the more frankly speak about, the more I was to talk about it.
I met people from all the roads in life, many of them doing what they were doing, living on the border of the possible.
And although I ended up my <unk> I realized I couldn't stay in a <unk>
I had to have another piece of the puzzle.
And I realized at the same time that's okay to be a stranger a new set on the scene -- and not just that it's fine, but it's something that is going to be grateful, perhaps a gift of the ship.
Because being inside it can easily mean <unk> <unk> can easily mean to accept the assumptions of your <unk>
I gave enough steps out of my comfort zone to know that, yes, the world gets <unk> but not the way we fear it.
They didn't have been <unk> they were <unk> tremendously.
There was a energy there, a <unk> <unk> a mix of humility and <unk>
So I followed my intuition.
<unk> a little group of people for the <unk> <unk> not <unk> was a <unk> challenge.
For a year we didn't have a <unk>
At the end of every day, I was doing a giant pot of soup that all <unk>
They were going to play the night.
Most of our ideas were mad, but some bright and we opened up to them.
I made the decision to move to the U.S.
After a journey of a journey.
My <unk>
Three months later, I had <unk> and <unk> adventure.
First of all, let me tell you about my grandmother.
She grew up in a time when the <unk> was the social norm and the local <unk> was the person who cared.
Life had not changed for centuries.
His father died shortly after she was born.
The mother grew up alone.
At 17 it became a <unk> of a <unk> whose mother <unk>
Without support of his husband, caused a <unk> to the <unk> and to bring the cause of it, and much more <unk> caused when I won.
And it cannot be <unk>
I was in the shower at the room in a hotel in <unk> when she died, a <unk> <unk>
I looked through the <unk> of the shower and I saw it stop on the other side.
I knew I had come to <unk>
My mother called a minutes later.
Days later, we went to a Buddhist temple in <unk> and we sat around his <unk>
We tell stories and make sure that we were still with it.
At night a monk came and told us that he had to close the <unk>
My mother asked us to <unk> his hand.
He asked the <unk> "Why your hand is hot, and the rest of the body so <unk>
"Because you have taken his hand from the <unk> he said.
They don't have <unk>
If there's a nerve in our family, that runs through women.
Since we were and how life built us together, we can now see that the men who have come to our lives would have <unk>
The defeat had been very easily.
Now I want to have my own kids, and I wonder about the ship.
Who might wish that for you?
But I'm afraid of the privilege of what's easy to do.
I can give you a <unk> in your lives, <unk> brave in every wave, the constant rhythm of the engine, the vast horizon that doesn't guarantee nothing?"
I don't know.
But if I could give them and see them safe I would do.
<unk> <unk> and also the mother of so much today -- in the fourth row of the row.
My story begins in <unk> about two years ago.
I was in the desert, under the <unk> sky with the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We were having a conversation about how nothing has changed from the age of the ancient Indian <unk> "The <unk>
In those days when Indians wanted to travel <unk> to a car, and <unk> the sky.
We now do it with airplanes.
At that time, when I was looking at the great prince warrior in Indian warrior -- I had <unk> it took a rainbow and with a <unk> on the ground, he got water.
We now do the same with <unk> and machines.
The conclusion that we took was that the machinery had replaced the magic.
And that was a lot of <unk>
Every time I felt a little bit more <unk>
I was given this idea of losing the ability to enjoy and appreciate a sunset if I didn't have the camera, if I couldn't afford my friends.
It seemed to me that technology had to allow magic to do not <unk>
From my grandfather my grandfather gave me her silver <unk>
And this piece of <unk> technology was for me the most magical thing.
It became a golden door to a world full of <unk> and <unk> in my imagination.
I had the feeling that mobile phones -- the luxury clocks and the cameras prevent them from <unk>
We have our inspiration.
So I told me, I threw myself into this technological world to see how to do it to create magic, instead of <unk>
<unk> books since 16 years.
So when I saw the iPad, I saw a narrative device able to connect to the readers of the entire world.
You can know how we take the book.
Where we are, where we are.
They put up the text with the image, animation and touch.
The narrative becomes increasingly <unk>
But what do we do for that?
I'm about to launch <unk> an interactive application for iPad.
It says, <unk> your fingers on each light.
And so ...  He says, "This box is <unk> I write my name.
And so I get a character in the book.
At several times you get a <unk> -- the iPad knows where I live through GPS -- that comes led to me.
My inner girl gets excited with all of these possibilities.
I've talked a lot about magic.
And I don't mean magicians and <unk> but to that magic of childhood to those ideas that are <unk>
For some reason, fireflies in a jar always turned me out.
So over here, we have to change the iPad to release fireflies.
And really, they light your way into what subtraction of the book.
Another idea that I was fascinated by a little girl was that a whole galaxy in a <unk>
So here, every book and every world becomes a <unk> that I drag into this magic device inside the device.
And this opens up a map.
In any fantasy book, there's always been maps but have been static maps.
This is a map that grows, <unk> and guide you for the rest of the book.
In certain points of the book also <unk>
Now I'm going to come in.
Another very important aspect to me is to create Indian content and at contemporary time.
These are the <unk>
We've all heard of <unk> and <unk> but how many people outside India know their counterparts <unk> the <unk>
These poor <unk> have been trapped in shark cameras for millennia, in an old and <unk> book.
So we're bringing them back into a <unk> child story.
In a story that deals with current issues like the environmental crisis.
And talking about the environmental crisis, one of the problems of the last 10 years has been that children have been <unk> attached to their <unk> have not gone out to the outside world.
But now with mobile technology, we can get our kids to the natural world with their technology.
One of the interactions of the book is this adventure that you have to go out outside the outside, take the camera or iPad, and we collect images of different natural objects.
As a girl I had a lot of <unk> <unk> stones, <unk> and <unk>
For some reason kids don't do it.
So to recover this childhood ritual that you have to go out and on a chapter, you have a picture of a flower and then <unk>
Another chapter, you have to take a picture of a piece of cortex and then <unk>
This is what a collection of the digital collection is created in the Web.
A kid in London puts a picture of a <unk> and he says, "Oh, I saw a <unk>
A child in India says, "I saw a <unk>
And it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital photos that have been taking.
Inside the variations between the magic, the Earth and technology are many possibilities.
In the next book we asked to have an interaction where you go out with the iPad and the video and on and through augmented reality, you see a group of cartoons that appear on the inner plants in the house.
At a moment the screen is full of leaves there.
And you have to make the sound of the wind and <unk> to be able to read the rest of the book.
We're going to go into a world where the forces of nature are linked with technology and magic and technology come to one another.
We will use the energy of the sun.
We're getting closer to our children and ourselves to the natural world and that magic, <unk> and child love that we sit through a simple story.
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about why many projects of <unk> <unk>
And I think, really, the most important thing about that is that we stopped listening to patients.
And one of the things we did at the University of <unk> was <unk> to a listening.
And not in a very scientific way, she raised a little cup of coffee or you and I asked patients, family and <unk> What <unk>
"How can we <unk>
And we tend to think, that this is one of the biggest problems for what all of us, or maybe not all, but most of the projects of <unk> they fail, because we stopped listening.
This is my scale Wi-Fi -- it's very simple.
It has a doorknob and it goes on.
Every morning I was shocked.
And yes, I have a challenge as you can see.
I put the challenge to 95 <unk>
But it's so simple, that every time I get <unk> sends my information to Google <unk>
And my doctor of <unk> has access to him as well. And so he can see what my weight problem is, not at the same time in which it needs <unk> or some urgency of that way, but it would look back.
But there's another thing.
Like some of you know, I have more than 4 followers on Twitter.
So every morning I connect to my scale and I connect to my car, the people start to <unk> <unk> today, I think you need a light lunch.
That's the best thing that can happen, because it's pressure from the base pairs to help patients, because it could be used for obesity, and also for patients to stop smoking.
On the other hand, it can be <unk> to move people out of their chairs and together develop some <unk> activity to have more control of their health.
From the week next week.
This little <unk> connected to an iPhone or another device.
And people are coming from their homes, to take their blood pressure to their doctor, and share it with others, for example, for 100 dollars.
This is the point where patients assume a position, come back and reclaim the control of their own <unk> but it can also help us care about health care because of the challenges that we face, as the firing of the costs of care, the <unk> of demand and other issues.
<unk> techniques that are simple to use and start with this to engage the patients in the team.
And they can do it with techniques like these, but also through <unk>
And one of the things we did like to share with you with a video.
We all have controls navigation in the <unk>
Maybe even we have them on our phones.
We know perfectly where <unk> <unk>
Where are all the <unk>
And of course, we can find fast food.
But where is the nearest <unk> to help this patient?
We asked but nobody <unk>
No one knew where to get the <unk> saving lives right now.
What we did was we made <unk> in the Netherlands.
We created a website, and we asked the public public, you see a <unk> for <unk> <unk> where, and when it's open, because sometimes they open up in <unk> office and others are closed.
And over 10,000 <unk> they already introduced in the Netherlands.
The next step was to look for the app for that.
And we made an app for the iPad.
We created an app for <unk> reality to find these <unk>
And every time you're in the city of <unk> and somebody else -- you can use your iPhone, and the next few weeks will use their <unk> cell phone to find the nearest <unk> which can save lives.
And from today, I'd like to introduce this one, not just like <unk> <unk> which is the name of the product, but also as a <unk>
And we want to do it in the global level.
We're <unk> all of the colleagues in the world, at other universities, so that we will help us find, work and act like a center for the <unk> of <unk> across the world.
Every time you're on vacation and someone <unk> can be a relative or someone in front of you, you can find it.
I also wanted to invite companies around the world that could help us validate these <unk>
They could be <unk> or <unk> people for example, to see if the <unk> that shows is still in place.
Please take care of this and not just better health, but take control of it.
Thank you very much.
I'm here to share <unk> photograph.
Or is it <unk> <unk>
Because, of course, they're photographs that can't take out of their cameras.
My interest in photography was woke up with my first digital camera for 15 years.
He mixed up with my earlier passion -- but it was a little bit different because by using the camera the process was in planning.
And when you take a photograph with a camera, the process ends up when the <unk> is <unk>
For me, photography had more to be in the right place, at the right time.
It seemed like anybody could do it.
So I wanted to create something different, a process that started when you press the <unk>
<unk> like this: a building on a very <unk> road <unk>
But it has a twist on it.
And despite it, it keeps a level of <unk>
Or pictures like <unk> dark and colorful and the common goal of keeping the <unk>
And when I say realism I say <unk>
Because of course, it's not something that can be <unk> but I always want it to be captured in some way like photograph.
<unk> where you have to think about a moment to discover the trick.
It has more to do with capturing an idea that we have to capture a moment.
But what is the trick that makes it really real?
Is it the details or the <unk>
Will the light?
What creates the <unk>
Sometimes the illusion is your perspective.
But at the end of the end, it's about our way to interpret the world and how you can perceive in a <unk> surface.
It's actually not about whether it's realistic but what we think is <unk>
So I think the foundations are very simple.
I see it as a puzzle of reality where we take different pieces of reality and we put them together to create an alternative reality.
Let me show you a simple example.
We have three perfectly <unk> objects that we can all relate to the three-dimensional world.
But combined in a certain way they can create something that still seems to be <unk> as if it was there.
But at the same time, we know it doesn't exist.
So let's go into the brain because the brain doesn't embrace the fact that that doesn't really make sense.
And I see the same process by combining the photographs.
It's really going to combine different <unk>
And the things that make a photo look a little bit realistic I think they're those in which we don't even have the things that are around us in our everyday lives.
But by combining photographs it's very important -- because otherwise something looks wrong.
So I would like to say that there are three simple rules that will continue to make realistic results.
As you can see, these images are not very special.
But <unk> can create something like this.
So the first rule is that the combination of photos must have the same perspective.
Second, the pictures <unk> must have the same kind of light.
And these two images come up with these <unk> were taken to the same height and the same kind of light.
The third point is to make it impossible to distinguish the principle and the end of the different images with a perfect child.
It has to be impossible to see where the image.
Here's another example.
You might think that this is the image of a landscape and the bottom is <unk>
But this image is totally comprised of photographs of different places.
And in the personal way, I think it's easier to create a place that it turns out, because you don't need to put the ideas on your head.
But it requires a lot of planning.
And as I thought of this idea in winter I knew I had several months to <unk> to find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle.
For example, the fish was captured on a fishing trip.
The shores are from a different location.
The <unk> part was captured in a stone.
And yes, I even made red the top house of the island to look more <unk>
So to make a realistic outcome, I think it takes planning.
You always start with a <unk> an idea.
Then you have to combine the different photographs.
And here every piece is very well <unk>
If you do a good job when you take the pictures the result it can be very beautiful and very <unk>
All the tools are there and the only limit is our imagination.
Thank you.
I'm going to start showing a slide on technology, very boring.
If you can <unk>
This is a diagram that I took from a folder of mine.
I'm not really interested in showing you the details but the general thing.
This is a analysis that we were doing about the power of <unk> <unk> versus the power of the local area.
The interesting thing about this is that this one, as a lot of other that we usually saw, is a kind of straight line on a <unk> scale.
In other words, every step of here represents an order of magnitude on the scale of performance.
I'm going to talk about technology with <unk> curves.
Here's something weird.
And that's exactly what I'm going to talk about.
Please light up the lights.
It gets more intensity because writing about paper.
Why are we looking at technology curves at <unk> scales.
The answer is that if you draw it on a normal curve in which, say, these are the years, or a unit of time, and this would be any part of the technology that I'd like to <unk> the diagram would look ridiculous.
It would be something like this.
It doesn't say much.
But if you ask for example, for example, some other technology, like transportation, in a <unk> curve, it would be very dumb, we would see a straight line.
But if something like this, it gives you a <unk>
If the technology of transportation will be as quickly as the past <unk> tomorrow we could take a taxi and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds.
But it doesn't go to that rhythm.
There is no unprecedented in the history of technological development of a <unk> growth that every few years will cost of magnitude.
The question I want to make is -- look at these curves <unk> we see that they don't go forever.
It's not possible to sustain this change as fast as it goes.
It would be one of two things.
Or is it okay to become a typical curve of this way until it comes up something completely different, or maybe I'll do something like that.
That's all that can happen.
I'm optimistic, and I think maybe something like this.
So we would now be in the middle of a transition now.
In this line we're in a transition from what used to be the world, to a new shape.
So what I'm trying to ask, is, what is that new way that you adopt the world?
What new state is moving the world?
The transition seems very, very confusing, if we're engaged in it.
I remember the future was happening in 2000, and people used to talk about what would happen in the year 2000.
This is a conference where people talk about the future, and we see that the future is still the year 2000.
That's all we see.
In other words, the future has been <unk> year after year, throughout my life.
But I think it's because we feel something that's going on.
We can feel a transformation, we can feel it.
And we know that it doesn't have a lot of sense to think about 30 or 50 years because everything is so different to extrapolate what we're doing today doesn't make any sense.
So I want to talk to you about how that might be, how it might be that transition that we <unk>
But to do that will have to talk a little bit about things that don't have a lot to do with technology and computer technology.
Because I think the only way to understand it is taking distance and look at the long term.
The scale of time I would like to do this is the time of life on Earth.
I think this image makes sense if we look at every billion years.
So we go back a few two and a half thousand years ago when the Earth was a big sterile rock with many chemicals that are going to be around them.
If we look at the way those chemists <unk> we give us an idea of how things happened.
And I think there's theories to start to understand the origin of the origin of RNA. I'm going to tell you a simple version of this -- and that is that, at that moment, there was a few <unk> of oil with all kinds of chemical recipes inside its inside.
Some of those oil droplet had had a particular combination of chemicals that made them incorporate materials from the outside and the drops grew out of it.
And they started <unk>
In a sense, those were the mobile forms of mobile forms, those <unk> of oil.
But those drops weren't alive in the current sense, because each of them contained a random recipe of chemicals.
And every time you get older, you get a <unk> distribution of the chemicals that we <unk>
So every <unk> was a little different.
In fact, the drops that in some way is being used to be better at the time to incorporate chemical <unk> more <unk> more chemicals and <unk> more.
Mostly they lived longer, they were more <unk>
It was a way of life -- a very simple chemistry, but things are really interesting to me when these blobs learned the trick of abstraction.
In some way that we don't understand very well these <unk> they learned to store information.
They learned to save information, which was the recipe for the cell, in a special chemical called DNA.
In other words, <unk> in this evolution that doesn't make sense, a writing system that allowed them to register what they were in order to be able to <unk>
The amazing thing is that that writing system seems to have remained stable since it evolved a half thousand years ago.
Our recipe, our genes, our genes, they have exactly the same code, that <unk> system.
In fact, every living being is expressed with exactly the same set of letters and the same code.
And one of the things I did just by <unk> Now we can write things with this code.
Here I have 100 <unk> of white dust that I'm trying to hide at the safety of the airport.
But <unk> I took this <unk> The code has the common letters that we tend to use in this -- and I wrote my personal data in this piece of DNA and it would take you 10 to 22 times.
So if someone wants to be 100 million copies of my personal card I've got a lot of them for all the <unk> in fact, for every person in the world and it's here.
If it was a <unk> it would have put in a virus, and it would have spread in the room.
What was the next <unk>
Writing DNA was an interesting step.
This made these cells happy another billion years.
But then another big step happened in which things became very different and that was that these cells started to exchange and communicate information to form on the cells.
I don't know if you know, but bacteria can exchange DNA.
That way, for example, evolved antibiotic resistance.
Some bacteria found the way to avoid penicillin and <unk> to create their little DNA with other bacteria and now there's a lot of resilient to penicillin because bacteria communicate.
This communication gave place that they would form communities that, in a way, they were together on it, and a <unk>
In that way, <unk> or <unk> together, or whatever if a community was very successful all the individuals of that community they become more and <unk> by evolution.
And the inflection point happened when these communities came so much that, in fact, they came together and decided to write all the recipe for the community board in a chain of DNA.
The next interesting stage for life took another billion years.
And at that stage we have communities that are <unk> communities of many different types of cells working together as a single organism.
In fact, we are a <unk> community.
We have a lot of cells that don't act alone.
The skin cell doesn't use the heart cell without the heart, or the brain of the brain, and so on.
So these communities evolved and produce more interesting levels than the cell phone, something we call a organism.
The next level happened within these communities.
These started <unk> information.
And to build very special structures that did not make more than process in the community.
They are <unk> structures.
<unk> are the devices that process the information that those cell communities built.
In fact, they started <unk> within the community being the responsible structures of <unk> understanding and convey the information.
Those were the brains and the nervous system of those communities.
And that gave them an evolutionary advantage.
Because at that moment as <unk> learning was confined to the duration of an organism, and not to the period of evolutionary time.
So one organism could, for example, learn to not eat some fruit because I knew bad and got sick last time she ate it.
That could happen during the life of an organism because they had been built these information processing structures that by evolution would have learned for hundreds of thousands of years by the death of individuals who ate that fruit of them.
So the fact that the nervous system built those information structures that accelerated the evolutionary process.
Because evolution might now happen confined to an individual.
It could happen in the time to learn.
But then, of course, individuals discovered the trick of communication.
So for example, the most <unk> version we know is the human language.
So if we think about it, it's an incredible invention.
I have a very complicated idea, a <unk> idea.
I'm sitting here I am sitting on emitting <unk> and hopefully building a very similar idea, <unk> and <unk> in your heads that holds some analogy to mine.
But we take something very complicated to do it in sound, in sound, in sound, and we produce something very complicated in another brain.
That now allows us to start to work as a organism.
In fact, as humanity, we've started to perform <unk>
We now go through periods of periods of the <unk> organisms -- our <unk> methods -- presentation and information processing.
For example, the invention of language was a little step in that direction.
The <unk> computer <unk> the video tape, <unk> and so on, are the specialized mechanisms that we now built to handle that information.
And that brings us into something much larger, faster and able to evolve more than we did before.
Now evolution can happen in microseconds.
You saw the evolutionary <unk> of <unk> where it produced some evolution with the <unk> program in front of our eyes.
And now we've accelerated the scales of time again.
The first stages of history that I told you took a billion years ago.
The next stages, the nervous system and the brain, took a few hundred million years.
The following, the language, and they took less than a million years.
And beyond, like electronics, seems to take only a few decades.
The process is <unk> I guess <unk> is the right word to name something that speeds up their own pace of change.
The more it changes, the faster you do.
And I think that's what we see in this explosion of the curve.
We see the process <unk>
But I make my life designing computers and I know that the mechanisms that work for <unk> would not be possible without the recent African advances.
But now design objects of such complexity that would be impossible for me to be <unk>
I don't know that every transistor in that machine of connections.
There are thousands of millions.
Instead of that, with the <unk> designers, we think of a level of abstraction, we put it into the machine and the machine with that something that was before you couldn't do it, it gets much further and faster than ever before.
In fact, sometimes they use methods that we don't even understand well.
A particularly interesting method I've been using today, is evolution itself.
We put into the machine an evolutionary process that operates on the scale of the microseconds.
And for example, in the most extreme cases, we can evolve a program from a random sequence of instructions.
We say, "Please use computer, you can run a hundred million <unk> sequences.
You could run these sequences of instructions at random, running all of those programs, and take those that are more attached to what we want to do?"
In other words, I define what I want.
So let's say I want to search numbers, to put a simple example.
So we found the programs that are closer to <unk>
Of course, it's unlikely that some random sequences of instructions, <unk> numbers, so none of them did it.
But once he could find two numbers on the right order.
And I said, <unk> you could take 10 percent of those random sequences that had better <unk>
They would take those and <unk> to the rest.
And now we're going to have the best of the numbers.
And back to <unk> following a process of <unk> analog to <unk>
Let's take two programs, that <unk> kids, which <unk> <unk> and that the children will get the properties of both programs.
So we got a new generation of programs from the combinations of programs that had a little more success.
And we say, "Please, repeat the <unk>
Let's try it again.
It would be some mutations here.
And it tries to try and get it back to another generation.
Well, every generation takes a few milliseconds.
So I can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution in a few minutes or in some complicated cases, in a few hours.
In the end, we end up with programs that orders numbers so absolutely perfect.
In fact, they are much more efficient programs than I could have written by hand.
If I look at those programs I can't say how they work.
And I've tried to hear them to see how they work.
They are dark programs, strangers.
But they meet <unk>
In fact, yes, I have the safety of the goal that they achieve because they come from a lineage of hundreds of thousands of programs that did it.
In fact, their lives depend on it.
One time I was in a 747 with <unk> <unk> and he pulls up a card and he says, "Look at this.
He says, <unk> plane has hundreds of thousands of <unk> working together to offer a <unk> flight.
We know that engineering processes don't work very well when they get complicated.
So we started to depend on computers to make design processes.
And that allows us to produce much more complex things than the normal engineering effect.
But we don't understand the whole options that there are.
In that sense, it goes in front of us.
Now we use those programs to make computers much faster and so they can run these programs much more rapidly.
I mean, it's <unk>
The thing goes faster and faster and so I think it seems so <unk>
Because all these technologies are <unk>
We're <unk>
And we're at a moment of analog organisms, when they became <unk>
We are the <unk> and we can't understand what the hell we're creating.
We're at the tipping point.
But I think something comes behind us.
I think it would be very arrogant from our part to think that we are the ultimate product of evolution.
And I think all of us are part of creating what it is to come.
But now it comes lunch and I think I'll stop here before I was <unk>
I think we have to do something with a part of the medical culture that must change.
And I think this starts with a doctor, and that's me.
And I've spent enough time to allow me to give me some of my false <unk> on that.
Before I was dealing with the theme of my talk, let's talk a little about baseball.
Why not?
We're close to the end, the World <unk>
We love baseball, right?
baseball is full of amazing statistics.
There are hundreds of statistics.
It's because of course, <unk> <unk> talks about the statistics and use them to form a great baseball team.
I'm going to focus on one of them and I hope that many of you know.
It's called <unk>
And we talked about 300 percent of a <unk> that <unk> 300.
That means the bat <unk> three of 10 times.
That means throwing the ball into the field of game without being <unk> and anyone who is about <unk> to the first base, not come to time, and the second foundation will be <unk>
Three <unk>
You know how they call a <unk> <unk> in the Big <unk>
Well, really well, maybe the team of the stars.
You know how they call a baseball <unk> of <unk>
By the way, that is somebody than 10 <unk> hit four.
<unk> as the Great Ted Williams, the last player of the largest League of <unk> in running 400 <unk> in a regular season in a regular season.
Now let's take this to my world of medicine where I feel much more comfortable or maybe less uncomfortable, after what I'll tell you today.
Suppose you have <unk> and they're a surgeon who has a record of 400 in <unk>
It doesn't work, right?
Now suppose that they live in a remote place and a wanted to have two <unk> <unk> and his family doctor comes to a cardiologist whose record in <unk> is 200 of 200 <unk>
But you know what?
She's getting better in this year.
And their hits have been <unk>
This is not working.
But I will ask you to ask you.
What do you think is the average of the hits of a heart surgeon or a nurse or a nurse or a <unk> <unk>
1,000, very well.
And the truth of the issue is that nobody in all of medicine knows the hits of a good surgeon, of a doctor or <unk>
What we do, though, is all the things in the world, and I would include myself with the line of being perfect.
That never, would never, ever make a mistake and try to figure out how to do it right.
That was the take-home message when I was in medical school.
I was a <unk> student.
Once, a fellow in high school said that Brian Goldman studied to a blood test.
Such which.
<unk> in my little <unk> in the <unk> residence of Toronto, not far from here.
And I learned all of memory.
From my class of anatomy, the origin and the muscle work, the <unk> of every artery that comes out of the <unk> the <unk> differential -- frequent and no standard.
And even I knew the <unk> <unk> about how to classify the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And as much more and more knowledge.
And I was really right. I graduated with <unk>
And <unk> from the school school with the impression that if you were doing everything -- then you would know everything, or more possible, close to everything, because I was afraid of the mistakes.
And it worked for a while, until I met Mrs. <unk>
I was a resident in a college hospital here, in Toronto, when they brought the lady to the emergency service of the emergency room where I worked.
At the time I was assigned to the <unk>
And when I applied to go to a cardiologist -- I was going to go to that patient.
And report to the chief of residents.
When I saw the lady, I was <unk>
I heard a <unk> sound.
And when I saw it, I heard a <unk> sound in both sides, which <unk> a heart failure.
In these conditions the heart stops working and, rather than pump the blood forward, the blood goes to your lungs, these are filled with blood, and that's why there's difficulty breathing.
And it wasn't hard to <unk>
I did it and I got to work on the treatment that I read it.
He gave him <unk> and medication to alleviate the pressure in your heart.
I gave him <unk> of water, so that it could get rid of liquid.
And in an hour or two, she started feeling better.
And I was very good.
And it was when I made the first <unk> he sent her home.
I actually made two more errors.
He sent her home without talking to the chief of residents.
I didn't get the phone, and I did what I should have done, which I was to call my boss and <unk> with him for the <unk>
And if my boss would have seen, would have been able to bring <unk> information.
Maybe I did it for a good reason.
Maybe I didn't want to be a resident who will pay constant attention.
Maybe I wanted to be so successful and able to take <unk> that I could take care of my patients without even contact my boss.
The second mistake I made was worse.
When I send her home, I don't pay attention to a voice in my interior that said, <unk> is not a good idea. Don't do it."
In fact, I was so confident that I asked the nurse who was telling the lady <unk> "Do you think it's okay if you go to your <unk>
And the nurse thought and then he said to complete <unk> "Yes, I think it's right."
I remember that as if it was yesterday.
So he was signed up with the <unk> and the ambulance with the ambulance took her home.
And I went back to the hospital.
The rest of that day, that afternoon, I had a bad <unk> in your stomach.
But I kept on my job.
At the end of the day, I was able to leave the hospital and walked into the parking lot where my car was to go home. And I did something I don't do normally, I don't do normally, I don't do normally, I don't normally do it.
I went through the emergency service service to home.
And there is another nurse, not the one that I was talking about, but another nurse, I was told by three words, those three words that most emergency medical doctors.
Other specialists are afraid too, but there's a <unk> in <unk> and it's that we see the patients <unk>
The three words are <unk>
Does the patient remember his <unk>
I asked the other nurse with total <unk>
And they said, "Well, she <unk> with the same tone of voice.
She was fine.
But I went back and at the edge of death.
Within an hour of having come to his house, after I would give her high school, she had a collapse and his family called the <unk> the ambulance was brought the emergency room with a blood pressure on 50 millimeters of <unk> which means a shock shock of it.
I was just breathing out and was blue.
The emergency staff <unk> all of their resources.
They gave him medication to raise your blood pressure.
And they put him an artificial <unk>
I was <unk> and <unk> to the core.
He had a mix of feelings because after the <unk> was in intensive therapy and waiting for all of hope that they were <unk>
And in the age of two or three days the next one was obvious that they never did.
He had a permanent brain damage.
The family came together.
And in eight or nine days, he was going to get to what was happening.
And at the ninth day, he left the lady <unk> wife, mother and grandmother.
They say they never forget the names that they die.
That was my first experience.
The weeks later, I was excited by that and experienced shame that exists in our medical culture, and I felt myself, <unk> without feeling that healthy shame because you can't get it to your colleagues.
You make peace and it never makes that mistake.
It's that shame that leaves questions.
<unk> shame that makes us feel very wrong with it.
It's the one that tells us not that what we did was wrong, but we're bad.
And that felt true.
And it wasn't for my <unk> he was a <unk>
I talked to the family and I'm sure I would hold things and made sure that I didn't get <unk>
And I kept getting those questions.
Why did I not ask my <unk> Why did he send him home?
And in my worst <unk> I made a mistake that <unk>
Why did I choose <unk>
Little to the feeling was <unk>
And I started to feel better.
And in a <unk> day, he opened the sky and finally went out and wondered if I would feel better again.
And I made a deal with myself in which if I was going to have the efforts to be perfect enough to make any more errors, I would make those voices.
And it was.
I went back to work.
It was going to happen.
Two years later, I was an <unk> in the emergency department in a community hospital in the north of Toronto, and I got a man from 25 years with a pain <unk>
I was very busy and <unk>
And he pointed out here.
I looked at her throat, I was a bit <unk>
He was <unk> penicillin and sent him home.
But as he ran to the door kept pointing his <unk>
Two days later, when I came to do my guard, my boss asked to talk to me with me <unk> in his office.
And he gave the three words: It remembers you?
Remember the patient who saw by a pain in the <unk>
Well, he came back and didn't have a <unk> <unk>
He had a potentially fatal condition called <unk>
You can search for Google. It's an infection, not from the throat, but the upper air goes up, and it can cause the closing of those tracks.
Luckily, he didn't die.
<unk> antibiotics is <unk> and recovered in the few days.
And I went through the same period of shame and <unk> then I went back to work, until it happened again and again and again.
Two times in the same <unk> turn on the same <unk> <unk>
And it's a big effort, especially working in a hospital, because they were going to get 14 patients at the same time.
But in both cases, I didn't send them home, and I don't think it's been a <unk>
One of them thought I had a <unk> <unk>
It was an X-ray of kidneys but it turned out, a colleague that was checking to the patient -- a certain sensitivity in the bottom corner and called the surgeon to <unk>
The other patient was with a lot of diarrhea.
And I took a liquid order to <unk> and I asked my colleague to <unk>
I checked it and to see some sensitivity in the bottom corner of the right corner called the surgeon.
Both of them were operated very well.
But every case <unk> I was <unk>
But I'd like to tell you that I made the worst mistakes in the first five years of exercise, and as many colleagues say, it's a <unk>
The most significant have been for the last five years.
<unk> ashamed and <unk>
And here's the problem: if I can't get a matter and talk about my mistakes, if I can't find the <unk> that tells me what really happens, how can I share this with my <unk>
How do I show you this so that they didn't make the same <unk>
If I would go into a place like this, I would have no idea what you think about me.
When was the last time you heard someone talk about failure, after failure, after failure?
Of course at a party you'll hear about the mistakes of other doctors, but you'll not hear someone talking about their own mistakes.
And if I knew and my colleagues as well, that a <unk> in my hospital <unk> the wrong leg, you know, I would have difficulty looking at the eyes.
This is the system that we have.
The total denial of mistakes.
It's the system where there are two <unk> those who make mistakes and the ones who make mistakes, and the ones that don't sleep and the ones that have <unk> the results that have a great results.
And it's almost like a <unk> reaction as a antibodies that starts to attack that person.
We have the idea that if you get from medicine to people who make mistakes, we will have a safe system.
But that brings two problems.
In 20 years of diffusion and journalism -- I have made a very poor medical D medical study and medical errors to learn what possible, from the first paper I wrote for Toronto "Star <unk> <unk> Black <unk> <unk> white, art.
And what I learned is that mistakes are <unk>
We work in a system where mistakes are happening every single day, where one in 10 drugs are wrong, in the hospital are wrong, or <unk> is not right. In a system where infections are going to be increasingly more and more <unk> and more <unk> causing chaos and death.
In this country, we're dying by 24 Canadian Canadian errors in medical mistakes.
The U.S. Institute established 100,000.
In both cases, it's about <unk> <unk> because we're not <unk> the problem as we should.
And that's what things are.
A <unk> system where knowledge is going to multiply every two or three years, and we are not <unk>
<unk> deprivation.
And we can't get rid of it.
We have cognitive biases that allow you to make a perfect record of a patient with pain.
Now, let's take the same patient with a chest pain comes <unk> with <unk> eyes, and with breath to alcohol and all of a sudden, my story was <unk> of contempt.
It's not the same story.
I'm not a <unk> I don't do things always the same.
And my patients are not cars. They don't have their symptoms always the same way.
All of this, the mistakes are inevitable.
So if we take the system out as we get <unk> and we eliminate all the professionals who are likely to error, well, you won't get anybody.
And with respect that people don't want to talk about their cases.
In my <unk> white art, <unk> art, it's a habit saying, "This is my worst <unk> I would tell everybody, from the ambulance up to the head of surgery, <unk> "This is my worst <unk> blah, blah, "What are your <unk> and <unk> the microphone into them.
And their students were <unk> and they will go down and <unk> and just start telling their stories.
They want to tell their stories, they want to share them.
They could say, "Look, they didn't make the same <unk>
They need a context where we can do it.
They need a medical culture.
And it starts with a doctor every time.
The <unk> doctor is human, you know human, and it doesn't be proud of their mistakes, but it tries to learn from what happened to teach others.
They had their experiences with them.
It's support for those who talk about their mistakes.
Do the mistakes of other people not with the intention of <unk> but in a loving way and support for everyone to be <unk>
And it works in a medical culture that recognizes that human beings run the system, and when this happens, they make mistakes rather than then.
My name is Brian <unk>
I'm a <unk> doctor.
I'm a human, <unk> mistakes in it.
And I feel a lot of but effort to learn something that can convey to others.
I don't know what you think about me, but I can live with that.
And let me close with three words: <unk> I remember.
Do you know how many decisions we take a day <unk>
Do you know how much we choose in a week?
I recently did a survey of more than 2,000 people and the average number of choices that says to choose a half a half a half a day.
It doesn't do a lot, in a research went for a week to a group of business.
So the researchers introduced the different <unk> of these executives and the time that we are going to do in making decisions about these tasks.
They found that, on average, <unk> <unk> <unk> jobs.
Naturally, every work included a lot of <unk>
Half of those decisions took nine minutes or less.
Just 12 percent required for an hour or more of their time.
Now think about their choices.
Do you know how many belong to the <unk> category and how many of an hour?
How do you think about the way those decisions?
Today I want to talk about one of the biggest problems that I want to talk about is one of the biggest problems of <unk> to pick up the options.
I want to talk about the problem and about some possible solutions.
As I talk about this I'm going to ask you a few questions, and I need to know their answers.
When I ask a question, as I'm blind, raise your hand if you want to burn calories.
In another way, when you ask a question, if your answer is positive for a <unk>
And now my first question: Are you ready to hear about the problem of <unk> <unk>
Thank you.
Being a graduate student at Stanford University, <unk> this very, very <unk> at least in that time was very sophisticated.
He was called <unk>
It was almost like going to a <unk> park.
There was like 250 different kinds of mustard and <unk> more than 500 different different kinds of fruits and vegetables and about 25 of <unk> water and this was when we took water from the tap.
I loved going to that store, but I was asked to tell me, why never do I buy nothing?
This is the <unk> oil shelf here.
They had more than 75 different classes, including the ones that were in <unk> <unk> that came from trees <unk>
I decided I was going to go to a manager and I said, "You know, well this strategy to offer all of these <unk>
He pointed out to me the buses full of tourists that came out every day, usually with their cameras.
We decided to do a little experiment with <unk> This is the <unk>
Both ways.
They had different kinds of different classes.
<unk> a post to <unk> just the entrance to the store.
We put it out there <unk> from six <unk> or 24 different flavors and we looked at two things: First, what case people were willing to stop testing the <unk>
More people stopped when there was a quarter of a quarter that when I was just six, 40 percent.
We also looked at what case they were more likely to buy a cup of <unk>
Here's the opposite effect.
From those who stopped when there was only three percent got to buy <unk>
Where he had six, we saw that 30 percent bought <unk>
If we do the calculations, people had six times more likely to buy <unk> if they found six.
Well, decide that we don't buy <unk> <unk> probably less good to keep the <unk> but it turns out that the problem of the decision-making rate affects us in good decisions.
We decided to do not to decide, even when this doesn't happen to us.
Now the issue of the day, the financial savings.
I'm going to describe to you a study that I did with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> where we see the decisions about savings for about a million Americans, in between about 650 plans of this country.
And we were interested in seeing if the number of advice available for savings plans, for retirement, <unk> program <unk> people to save for the future.
And we found that I actually had a <unk>
We had <unk> plans that went from two, to 59 options.
We found that the bigger the number of funding was <unk> there were less participation.
So if we look at the extreme, we see that in the plans that they offer two funding, the rate of participation was 70 or more, not as high as they wanted to.
And in the plans that would be offered about 60 funding, the rate of participation went to the '60s.
It turns out even if you decide to participate, when there's more choices, even in that case, there are negative consequences.
So what they decided to participate, as much more people was the number of choice, more people will be paid to avoid actions or investment funds.
As soon as he had more options, they were more willing to invest in financial financial accounts.
But none of these extreme decisions are the ones that are going to be <unk> to optimize financial well-being future.
In the previous decade we've seen three negative consequences to offer more and more possibilities.
The most likely thing is that they will make the decision, the <unk> even when this is against the self-interest.
It's more likely to take the worst decisions in finance and health.
They are more likely to choose less <unk> even though they observed it will be better.
The main reason is that we have to look at that massive array of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> but we are not able to do the calculations for comparison, contrast and choose that awesome <unk>
Today I want to <unk> four simple techniques that we have, in one way or another, in different research, so you can test in your business.
The first is, <unk>
You've heard before, but it's never been more true than today, that less than today.
People always bother when I say, <unk>
They care about losing space in the <unk>
But actually what we're seeing more and more is that if you decide to be cut, you get rid of the weird <unk> options, there will be an increase in sales, you get a better experience in choice.
When <unk> & <unk> went from 26 different types of <unk> & <unk> to 15, saw a rise of 10 percent in sales.
When the Golden Golden <unk> eliminated the products of cats that are less likely to eat the <unk> in <unk> by two <unk> higher sales and lower costs.
You know, you know that rating today, on average, they give 45,000 products.
In a Walmart shop, it provides about 100,000 products.
But the ninth largest store in the current world is <unk> and it offers only 1,400 <unk> a kind of tomato sauce in tin.
In the financial savings world, I think one of the best examples that have emerged on how to handle better choices is the author of David <unk> the Harvard program.
All of the employees of Harvard are <unk> automatically to a safe fund of life.
The people who really want to choose, are offered 20 funding, not 300 or more.
You know, people often say, "I don't know how to <unk>
All of them are <unk>
The first thing I do is to ask the <unk> <unk> the differences that are between those options.
And if your employees cannot afford it, they can't do it either.
This afternoon, before I started this session, I was talking to <unk>
He told me that it would be willing to offer people in this audience a holiday with all paid the most beautiful road in the world.
Here, a <unk>
I want you to read it.
I'm going to leave a few seconds to <unk> and then I want you to give you a round of applause if you're ready to take the <unk>
<unk> <unk> Okay. Anyone who is ready to accept the deal.
They're not more?
Well, I'm going to show you something else.
You knew there was a trick.
Who is ready for that <unk>
I think I actually got to hear more hands.
All right.
Actually, you had more information in the first turn, which in the second turn, but I can tell you that they thought that the second time was real.
Because the images were made more real.
This brings me to the second technique to handle the <unk> problem that is <unk>
For people to understand the differences between choice, they have to understand the consequences of each choice, and that the consequences must feel very highly <unk>
Why are people spending 15 to 30 percent more on average, when they use debit cards or credit that when they use <unk>
Because it doesn't seem to be real money.
It turns out to make it more real, it can be a very positive tool for people to do more.
We did a study with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> on <unk> staff, who were working on <unk> these people were in a meeting where they were <unk> to a <unk> plan.
In that meeting, which <unk> exactly as <unk> we had a little <unk>
What we added was the staff who would think of the positive things that they would think about their lives if they were saving more money.
With this <unk> there was a increase in the <unk> of 20 and an increase in the number that they were interested in saving or what they wanted to put in their <unk> accounts for <unk>
The third technique is <unk>
We can drive more categories than options.
For example, this is a study that we did in a hallway of magazines.
We saw that in supermarkets, <unk> over the <unk> the magazine exhibition can contain from <unk> different types to <unk>
But, you know?
Because <unk> tells me how to <unk>
These are two <unk>
One is called <unk> and the other.
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> give them a <unk>
<unk>
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> give them a <unk>
Well, something else.
It turns out it's right.
The one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> But you know what?
This classification scheme is totally useless.
<unk> are supposed to indicate something to <unk> not to the <unk>
And you often see this problem with those huge fundraising.
I wish who they are <unk>
My fourth <unk> <unk> complexity.
And it turns out that we can handle a lot more information than we think about if just <unk> a little bit.
We have to increase the complexity gradually.
I'm going to show you an example of what I mean.
Let's see a good decision -- you buy a car.
This is a German car manufacturer that allows you to get completely <unk>
You have to make 60 decisions, to put the car.
And these decisions vary in the number of choices that serves each one.
The outside color of the car. I have 56 possibilities.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
What I'm going to do is we vary the order in which the decisions.
So half of the customers are going to go out of a lot of choices, 56 colors, a few thousand boxes.
The other half of the customers are going to go from a few choices, four <unk> to 56 colors, many options.
And what am I going to do?
What do you do?"
If you get a defect in the defect in every decision, it indicates that they're <unk> or <unk> we're <unk>
What we found is that the ones that go from many choices at all of times, <unk> the default button again and again, and another one.
<unk>
If you go from a few choices to many, they continue there.
The same information, the same amount of options.
The only thing I did was to alter the order in which the information happens.
If we start with it, you learn to <unk>
Even though you pick the box of change doesn't tell anything about the preferences of interior <unk> in all ways you made us to choose.
We're excited about a product that we're building that now has more <unk> with the process.
To sum up.
I've talked about four techniques to mitigate the problem of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> we can drive more categories at least <unk> <unk> complexity.
All of these techniques that I've introduced you were designed to help drive the <unk> or better, for you, to use them in their issues, or for people who will work.
It's that I think the key to getting the best of a choice is to be careful to <unk>
And the more careful we are in our best choices we can practice the art of choice.
Thank you very much.
In the 1950s, East Germany, <unk> if you had a typewriter to the government.
I had to register a leaf text leaf <unk>
And this is why the government could track the origin of the texts.
If they found a written on the wrong message, you could track the footprint up to the origin of the idea.
In the West, we don't think that someone could do this, how much this is going to make the freedom of expression.
We would never do that in our countries.
But today, in 2011, if you buy a laser printer from any big manufacturer of any big manufacturer on a page, that page will end up having a little printed yellow print on each page that follow a pattern and your printer.
That's happening today.
And nobody looks a lot like this.
This is an example of the ways that our governments use technology against us, citizens.
And it's one of the three main causes of problems on the network.
If you look at what happens in the online world we can put together the attacks on their <unk>
There are three main groups there.
Are you the <unk>
Like Mr. <unk> <unk> of the city of <unk> in Ukraine.
<unk> cell phone is very easy to understand.
These guys make money.
They use cyberattacks to make a lot of money, a huge amount of money.
There are really a lot of <unk> people online, <unk> that they would bring money out with their attacks.
This is <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>
This is Alfred <unk>
This is Stephen <unk>
This is <unk> <unk>
These are Matthew Anderson, <unk> <unk> etc., etc.
These guys do their online <unk> but they do it by illegal means by illegal <unk> to steal money from our bills when we bought in <unk> or steal our keys to get information from our cards when we bought a computer <unk>
The secret service of America, two months ago, <unk> the Swiss account of this guy, Sam <unk> and this counts had <unk> million dollars when it was frozen.
Mr. <unk> is <unk> your <unk>
And I say today more likely than any of us is a victim of a real <unk> than a real crime.
And it's very obvious that this is going to be wrong with worse.
In the future, most crime crimes online.
The second group of <unk> in the importance we see today is not driven by money.
There's another thing that drives them, motivate them the protests, motivate them the opinions, motivate them.
Groups like Anonymous have been <unk> in the last 12 months occupying a major role in the online attacks.
Those are the three main <unk> the criminals who do it for money, the <unk> as Anonymous who do to protest and the last group are the United Nations the United Nations governments that are <unk>
And then we see cases like <unk>
That's a good example of a government attack against its own citizens.
<unk> is an <unk> authority of the Netherlands, or actually it was.
<unk> the <unk> last fall because of a <unk>
I would raise the safety of the site and bring a <unk>
Last week, I asked, in a meeting with the government representatives of the Dutch government, asked one of the leaders if <unk> <unk> people from the attack to <unk>
And the answer of it was yes.
So how do people die from a heart attack.
<unk> is an Indian authority.
<unk> <unk>
What is the <unk>
Well, you need if you have a website with <unk> services, <unk> services like <unk>
Except that they were giving a foreign authority authority.
And that was the ultimate <unk>
And in the case of <unk> it happened exactly that.
And what happened in the Arab Spring and those things that have happened, for example, in <unk>
Well, in Egypt the <unk> protesters the headquarters for the Egyptian police headquarters in April 2011 and during the <unk> of the building, they found a lot of papers.
Among those papers was this folder called <unk>
And within that folder there were notes in a company based in Germany who had sold the Egyptian government tools to intercept the communications of the citizens of the country.
They had sold this tool for <unk> euros to the <unk> government.
The company headquarters is right here.
I mean, Western governments provide the tools to <unk> governments to do this to their citizens.
But Western governments also do this themselves.
For example, in Germany, just a couple of weeks ago, I found the <unk> <unk> a <unk> used by government officials to investigate their own citizens.
If you're suspected of a criminal case -- well, it's pretty obvious that your phone is <unk>
But today it goes further.
It was <unk> the connection to the Internet.
<unk> even tools like <unk> <unk> to infect our computer with a <unk> to allow them to see all the communication, and listen to the discussions online, to get our data.
When we think about things like this, the obvious answer should be "Well, it looks a bad thing, but it doesn't really affect me because I'm an honest citizen.
Why would you <unk>
I have nothing to <unk>
And that argument doesn't make sense.
It's in play.
Privacy is not <unk>
It's not a question of privacy against safety.
It's about freedom against control.
If we could be able to trust our governments today in 2011, any right that we're going to have to be forever.
Let's vote for any future government, in a administration that we could have within 50 years?
These are the questions that have to be worried about the next 50 years.
Here is where I live, I live in Kenya, in the south of National Park in Nairobi.
These are the cows of my dad, and the back of the cows, the National Park of Nairobi.
National Park has no fences at most of the south, which means that wild animals like <unk> migrate to the park.
And predators, like the lions, they follow them, and this is what they do.
<unk> our won.
This is one of the ones that killed by the night, and as soon as we wake up in the morning and found it dead because it was the only <unk> that we had.
My community, the <unk> we think we came from the sky with our animals and all the land for <unk> and so we value it so much.
So I grew up <unk> a lot of the lions.
People were the warriors who protect our community and cattle, and they are mad at the problem.
So they kill lions.
This is one of the six lions that killed in Nairobi.
I think this is so few in the National Park in Nairobi.
A kid in my community, six to nine years old, is responsible for the livestock of his father and this was the same thing that happened to me.
So I had to find a way to solve this problem.
My first idea was to use fire, because I thought the lions were scared.
But I realized that I didn't really get to <unk> because I even helped lions to see the pen away.
I didn't get <unk>
A second idea was to use a <unk>
He was trying to trick lions so they believed that I was close to the <unk>
But lions are very intelligent.  They came the first day and saw the <unk> and they were, but the second day, they went back and said, "This thing is not going to be here.  So I went up and killed animals.
So one night I was walking around the pen with a torch and that day lions didn't come back.
I found that lions are afraid of light that moves around.
So I had an idea.
And I got a switch on that turn on and turn out the lights.
And this is a little <unk> of a <unk>
They were doing everything.
As you can see, the solar panel load the battery and the battery <unk> the electricity to the small box -- I call it a transformative.
And the <unk> box makes the lights <unk>
As you can see, the <unk> get outside, because that's where lions.
And this is what lions see when they come from night.
<unk> lights and <unk> the lions to think that I'm walking through the <unk> but I'm sleeping on my bed.
Thank you.
So I put them in my house two years ago, and since then, we never went back to have problems with lions.
And the neighborhood houses heard the idea.
One of them is this grandmother.
She had killed a lot of animals, the lions and asked me if I could put the lights out.
I said yes.
You can see them, you can see the bottom, these are the lights for lions.
Since then, I've been installed in seven houses in my community, and they're serving a lot.
And my idea is also used right now by Kenya, to freak out other predators like hyenas, <unk> and it's also using <unk> elephants as well.
Thanks to this invention, I was fortunate enough to get a scholarship in one of the best schools in Kenya, <unk> Medical School, and I'm very excited.
My new school is now helping to raise funding and <unk>
And I even took my friends to my community and installed lights in the houses that don't have them, and teach them how to <unk>
So a year ago, it was just a kid in the meadows of the savanna savanna cows of my father, and I used to see flying airplanes and told me that one day would be inside one.
And here I am.
I got the opportunity to come in airplane for the first time to TED.
My great dream is to become a aviation engineer and a pilot when I grow up.
I used to hate the lions, but now as my invention is saving cows from my dad and lions, we can be with lions without any conflict.
<unk> <unk> What in my language means, thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You don't picture how exciting a story is to hear a story like yours.
So you got a <unk> Richard <unk> Yes.
CA: Are you working on other electrical inventions here.
What's the next thing in your list?
<unk> My next invention is -- I want to make a little bit of electric <unk> One near <unk>
<unk> I know you invented electric <unk> but I want to do mine.
CA: So I would take it over the same time, right now, right? I've tried it before, but I got a <unk>  CA: When the canyon. Richard <unk> is a big thing.
We're going to <unk> in every single step that I want my friend of mine.
Thank you very much. <unk> Thank you very much.
When I was a little, I thought my country was the best of the planet.
I grew up singing a song called "No <unk>
And I felt very proud.
In school, we would move all the time studying the story of Kim <unk> but we never learned a lot of the rest of the world, except that America, South Korea, Japan are the enemies.
Even though I was going to ask myself about the rest of the world, I thought I would happen all my life in North Korea, until everything changed suddenly.
When I was seven years old, I saw my first public run.
But I thought my life in North Korea was normal.
My family was not poor and I had never been hungry.
But one day, in 1995, my mom brought a letter from my sister from my sister.
What said, "When we <unk> this five members of the family will stop there in this world, because we haven't eaten in the last few weeks.
We're <unk> together on the floor, and our bodies are so weak, we're ready to die."
And I was very hot.
It was the first time I heard that people were suffering in my country.
When I was walking in front of the train station, I saw something terrible that I can't erase my memory.
A woman without life was dead, in the street, holding a child <unk> in his arms looking at his mother's face without being able to do anything.
Nobody <unk> because they were very concerned about taking care of themselves and their families.
A huge famine <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
In the end, over a million North Koreans died during famine and only a few survived eating grass, insects and <unk>
They also became more and more prevalent the energy cuts all around it was completely dark at night except for the lights in China, barely crossing the river from my house.
I always wondered why they had light and we don't.
This is a satellite picture of North Korea at night compared to the countries.
This is the <unk> river between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very <unk> in certain points, allowing North Koreans to cross <unk>
But many die.
Sometimes, I saw bodies floating in the river, floating in the river.
I can't reveal the details of how I left North Korea, but I can only say that during the years of famine I was sent to China to live with <unk> relatives
But I just thought I'd be separated from my family for short time.
I could never have imagined that I would take 14 years to live together.
In China, it was difficult to live as a young woman without my family.
I had no idea what life would be like as a refugee refugees.
But soon I learned that it's not just extremely difficult, but also dangerous, because the North Koreans in China were considered illegal <unk>
So I was living with a constant fear that my identity was <unk> and it would be <unk> to a horrible fate back in North Korea.
A day, my worst nightmare was actually done when I was arrested by the Chinese police and I was arrested at the police station.
Somebody had been accused of being <unk> then I would get my skills in the Chinese language and asked me a lot of questions.
I was <unk>
I thought my heart was going to explode.
If it didn't seem natural, it could be incarcerated and <unk>
I thought my life was going to end.
But I managed to control my emotions and answered the questions.
At the end of the <unk> a officer told another, "This was a fake report. She's not <unk>
And let me go. It was a miracle.
Some Koreans in China looking for asylum.
But many of them can be arrested by Chinese police and <unk>
These women had a lot of luck.
Even though it had been <unk> it was eventually released after a harsh international pressure.
These North Koreans were not so lucky.
Every year, countless Koreans are captured in China and <unk> North Korea, where they're <unk> <unk> or executed in public.
Even though I was lucky to escape, many other North Koreans have not had so much luck.
It's tragic that North Koreans have to hide their identities and fight so hard just to survive.
Even after learning a new language and find work, all of your world can be done in a second.
That's why after 10 years of hiding my identity, I've decided to be going into South Korea <unk>
And I started a new life again.
<unk> in South Korea was a much greater challenge than I was supposed to.
English was very important in South Korea, I had to start learning my third language.
Also, I understood that there was a big gap between North and south.
We're all <unk> but inside, we have come to be very different because of 67 years of <unk>
I even went through a identity.
I'm a <unk> or <unk>
Where am I? Who am I?
Suddenly, there was no country I could call a pride of mine.
Even though I went to life in South Korea it wasn't easy, I made a plan. I started studying for the school exam to college.
Just when I was starting to <unk> my new life, I got an alarming call.
The North Korean authorities had a little bit of money that sent back to my family, and as wise my family was going to be displaced to the force to a location outside of <unk>
They had to run away from immediately.
So I started planning how to help us escape.
North Koreans have to travel long distances on the way to freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Korea.
So, ironically, I took a flight to China and went to the border with North Korea.
Because my family couldn't speak Chinese -- I had to put them in a way, for over 3,000 miles across China and then across Southeast Asia.
The journey in <unk> took one week, and we were almost caught several times.
Once, our bus was stopped and approached by a Chinese police officer.
He asked all of you all over and started asking them questions.
As my family couldn't understand Chinese, I thought my family was going to be arrested.
When the Chinese officer came up to my family, <unk> I stood up and I told him that they were <unk> people who was <unk>
I looked at me <unk> but fortunately I did.
We did all the way up to the border of <unk>
But I had to spend almost all of my money to bribe the border guards in <unk>
But even after the border, my family was arrested and incarcerated for crossing the border <unk>
After <unk> <unk> and bribes, my family was liberated in a month.
But at time, my family was arrested and incarcerated again in the capital of <unk>
This was one of the lowest dots in my life.
I did everything by releasing my family, and we were so close -- but my family was <unk> in prison at short, from the South Korea.
I was going and came between the <unk> office and the police station, desperately trying to liberate my family.
But it didn't have enough money to pay more bribes or <unk>
I lost hope.
At that moment, or the voice of a man wondering, "What is the problem?"
I was so surprised that a stranger would ask to ask.
With my poor English and with a dictionary, I told him the situation, and without <unk> the man was the <unk> and he gave me the rest of the money for my family and for other two Koreans and them to get them out of prison.
I ran out with all my heart, and I asked him, "Why do I <unk>
"I'm not <unk> I said.
"I'm helping the village <unk>
I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life.
The kind nameless stranger would have a new hope for me and for the people to <unk> when I was more <unk>
And I showed me that the kindness of strangers and the support of the international community are really the rays of hope that the people are <unk> needs.
Over time, after our long journey, my family and I met in South Korea.
But your freedom is only half the battle.
A lot of North Koreans are separated from their families and when they go to a new country, they start with a little bit of money.
So, we can benefit from the international community with education, practices of work, design practices and more.
We can also act as a bridge between people in North Korea and the rest of the world.
Because many of us continue to contact with family in the living inside, and we send information and money that is helping to change North Korea from within.
I've been very <unk> I've gotten a lot of help and inspiration in my life, so I want to help North Koreans an opportunity to thrive with international support.
I'm sure you're going to see more and more North Koreans -- all over the world, including on the TED stage.
Thank you.
I live in South Pole.
This is Center for <unk> shops -- fast food <unk>
So the city planners came together and they thought, we're going to change the name of South Center for it to represent something else, so they changed it to the South Side -- as if this is <unk> what's actually wrong in the city.
This is Los Angeles <unk>  <unk> <unk> -- fast food <unk>
Just like <unk> millions of other American Americans live in a food desert, Los Angeles and the home of the food places to bring and eat in the car.
The curious thing is that the food places to bring kill more people than food in the car.
People are dying of infectious diseases in Los Angeles <unk>
For example, the rate of obesity in my neighborhood is five times larger than just 15 miles away.
I think this will happen.
And I ask myself, how would you feel if you don't have access to healthy food, and if every time you go out of house you see the <unk> effects that the current food system has in their <unk>
I see the wheelchair <unk> and sold as a self-driving cars.
I see <unk> centers like <unk>
And I think this must stop.
I think the problem is the solution.
Food is the problem, and it's the solution.
And I also got tired of driving 45 minutes to go back to buy an apple that has no pesticides.
What I did, was plant a food forest in front of my house.
In a <unk> of land we call a <unk>
That's 45 meters x three.
The point is, it belongs to the city.
But you have to keep it down.
I said, "Well, I can do what it comes to me, because it's my responsibility and I have to <unk>
So this is how I decided to keep it down.
So my group and I, L.A. Green <unk> we put together and we started planting our food forest <unk> trees -- you know, nine complete vegetables.
What we do, we are a kind of paid group ahead of <unk> by gardeners of all the entire city and completely volunteer, and everything we do is free.
And the garden, was beautiful.
Then someone got <unk>
And the city got me on top of it, and in <unk> they gave me a <unk> saying that I had to take my garden.
And I said, "Come on, right?
A court protection by plant food in a piece of land that nobody <unk>  So I was like, "Well, you know, <unk>
Because this time I wasn't going to happen.
In L.A. Times had the story written by Steve <unk> and I talked to the <unk> and one of the Green School members who put a petition in <unk> with 900 <unk> we were a success.
We had the victory in our hands.
My <unk> even called it to say that <unk> and <unk> what we were doing.
I mean, we go, why not?
L.A. is the city of America with more <unk>
It has 68 miles of <unk>
That's about 20 Central <unk>
That's space enough to plant <unk> million blood plants.
Why on earth does it not seem like this?
<unk> a plant will give a thousand seeds.
When a dollar of <unk> will give you 75 dollars.
It's my <unk> when I tell people, you cultivate your own food.
<unk> your own food is how to print your own money.
You see, I have a legacy for South <unk>
I grew up there. It was my kids there.
I became a part of this <unk> reality that was <unk> for others, and I'm going to manufacture my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
<unk> is my <unk> I culture my art.
Such a <unk> artist who <unk> walls, I <unk> soils, <unk>
I use the garden, land as a piece of canvas, and the plants and the trees, are my <unk> of that canvas.
You will be able to see what the Earth can do.
You just can't imagine how amazing it is a <unk> and how it affects people.
What happened?
I witnessed how my garden became a <unk> tool of my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the land.
We are the land.
They are trying to see how they affect guys.
<unk> is the most <unk> act and provocative thought that they can do, especially in a <unk>
In addition, you get <unk>
I remember one occasion, who came up with a mother and her daughter, were like the <unk> of the night and they were in my own garden, and they looked very <unk>
I, well, man, I felt bad that you were there, and I said, you know, you don't have to do this.
This is on the street for a reason.
I felt shame when I see people that was so close to me with hungry, and this just <unk> why I do this, people ask me, <unk> not temes that people will steal your <unk>
What I say, "For God no, I'm not afraid you're going to go to <unk>
That's in the street.
That's what it's about.
I want you to do the <unk> but at the same time, I want you to <unk> your <unk>
There was another occasion where I put a garden in a <unk> in the middle of Los <unk>
They were these guys, who helped me download the truck.
It was great, they gave me their stories about how this was affected and how they used to plant with their mom and his grandmother, and it was fabulous to see how this changed the way that it was just just for a moment.
So Green <unk> has come to plant -- maybe 20 <unk>
We've had about 50 people who come from, work and <unk> every volunteer.
If kids are growing up, the kids will eat <unk>
If you grow tomatoes, they will eat <unk>  But if none of this is <unk> if you don't teach them how food affects the minds and the body, eat blind what you put in front of you.
I see young people who want to work on, but they have this thing where you're sitting on, I see these guys that are on this path designed for them, which doesn't take them nowhere.
With the <unk> I see a chance in which we can train these kids who would train their communities to have sustainable life.
And when we do this, who knows?
Maybe the next George Washington, <unk>
But if we don't change the composition of the land, we never will.
Now this is one of my plans, this is something I want to do.
I want to plant a whole block from gardens, where people can share food in the same block.
I want to take <unk> and make them a healthy <unk>
I don't get <unk>
I'm not talking about free, because the free is not sustainable.
What's curious about sustainability, you have to <unk>
What I'm talking about is to try to work on people, getting kids out of the street, who know the <unk> the pride and the honor of growing their own food, by opening of farmers.
What I want to do here, we have to make it sexy.
I want everyone to become <unk> <unk> <unk> gardeners <unk>
We need to change the script of what's a <unk>
If you're not a <unk> you're not a <unk>
What are you going to take your <unk> take their <unk>
That is his weapon of choice.
In <unk> if you want to meet with me, well, if you want to see me, you don't call me to sit in comfortable chairs and have meetings to talk about making some <unk> to talk about making some shit.
If you want to see me, you come into the garden with your <unk> so that we can plant something.
Peace 2: Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk>  <unk> of the <unk>  You probably all agree with me in which this is a very nice road there.
It's made from <unk> and the asphalt is a good material to drive, but not always, especially in days like today, where it rains a lot.
They can have a lot of water in asphalt than <unk>
And especially if you're going on in your bike, and these cars are not very nice.
Also, the asphalt can make a lot of noise.
It's a noisy material, and if we build roads, like in the Netherlands, very close to cities, we would want a silent road <unk>
The solution for that is to make roads on asphalt <unk>
The asphalt <unk> a material that we use now in most of the roads in the Netherlands, has <unk> and water can go through it, so all the water flow flow into the sides and you will have a road that is easy to drive, and it doesn't make water never more.
The noise also disappear in these <unk>
Because it's very hollow, all the noise disappear, so it's a very silent way.
It also has <unk> of course, and the downside of this road is that you can <unk>
What is <unk> You can see that on this road rocks goes out of the ground.
So first a stone, then then many more and more and more, etc., and <unk> -- well, I'm not going to do that.  But you can damage your <unk> and you won't be happy with that.
And finally, this can also lead more and more damage.
Sometimes they can create <unk> with that.
<unk> It's ready.
<unk> of course, you can become a problem, but we have a solution.
So here you can actually see the damage in this material.
It's a <unk> asphalt as I said, so it only has a little amount of <unk> between stones.
Because of the <unk> to the light -- the <unk> this <unk> the glue between the <unk> are <unk> and if they were <unk> they will be <unk> and getting out of the <unk>
So if you drive through the road, you will take the <unk> and we saw it here.
To solve this problem, we think of <unk> materials.
If we can make this material <unk> then we probably have a solution.
So what we can do is we can use knitting <unk> from that for clean <unk> and we can cut out steel wool on little pieces and we can mix these little pieces with the <unk>
So we have asphalt with little pieces of steel wool on it.
Then you need a machine, like the one you see here, you use to give you a <unk> machine.
<unk> can heat, especially steel, it's very good at that.
So what you need to do is to heat the steel, melt the <unk> flow through these <unk> and the stones will be transferred back to the surface.
Today I used a <unk> <unk> because I can't bring the big <unk> machine here to the stage.
The microwave oven is a similar system.
I put the show that I'm now going to get to see what happened.
This is the show that comes out now.
I said we have this kind of industrial machine in the lab to heat the shows.
We tried a lot of samples there, and then the government, actually saw our results, and they thought, "Well, that's very interesting. We have to <unk>
So we donated a piece of road, 400 meters out of the <unk> highway where we had to make a test lane test this material.
So that's what we did there. You see where we were doing the test test, and then, of course, this road will last several years without any harm. That's what we know about practice.
We took a lot of samples from this road and test them in the lab.
We did age the samples, we put a lot of burden on them, and then we came down with our <unk> machine, and we went back to it.
We can repeat this many times.
Well, to conclude, I can tell you that we have made a material using fiber fibers to make these fibers, using the energy of <unk> to actually increase the lives of the surface of the road, even you can double the life of the surface of the surface. They can actually save a lot of money with very simple tricks.
And now, of course, they are curious about whether this works.
We still have the sample here. It's pretty hot.
It actually has to cool first before I can show you how it acts on it.
But I'm going to do a try.
Let's see. Yes, it worked.
Thank you.
When I was 11, I remember having woken up one morning with the sound of the <unk> in my house.
My father was listening <unk> on his little gray radio.
He had a big smile in his face that was unusual at those times, because the news is generally <unk>
"The Taliban <unk> she screamed my father.
I didn't know what <unk> but I could see my father was very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a <unk> school, he said.
One morning I will never forget.
A real school.
You see, I was six years old when the Taliban ran from Afghanistan and they made illegal girls to go to school.
For the next five years, I was <unk> as a child to <unk> my older sister who could no longer be outside to go to a secret school.
It was the only way we could do it for them.
Every day, we would take a different route for one that nobody could suspect where they were.
We had to hide the books in the market bags so that it looks like we were shopping.
The school was in a house, more than 100 of us stuck in a small room.
It was nice in the winter, but extremely <unk> in the summer.
We all knew that <unk> our lives, the teacher, the students and our parents.
Once in a while, the school suddenly closed for a week, because the Taliban <unk>
We always wondered what they knew from.
They were <unk>
Did you know where you are."
We were <unk> but still, the school was where we wanted to be.
I was very lucky to grow in a family where education was <unk> and the daughters a <unk>
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time.
A total <unk> of a remote province of Afghanistan. They were in that his daughter, my mother, went to school, and so his father was <unk>
But my educated mother became a teacher.
This is her.
It took out two years ago, just to convert our house to school for girls and women from our neighborhood.
And my father, this is the first of her family in getting education.
There was no doubt that their children had to receive education, even their daughters, despite the <unk> despite the risk.
For him, there was a higher risk in not to educate your children.
For the years of <unk> I remember there were moments when I was very frustrated with our life and was always scared and I didn't see a future.
I wanted to realize, but my father said, <unk> my daughter -- you can lose everything you have in life.
You can steal your money. They can help leave your house for a war.
But there is one thing that will always be with you, what's here and if we have to sell our blood to pay your education, we will.
So, you don't want to do it.
I'm 22 years old.
I grew up in a country which has been destroyed by decades of war.
Less than six percent of the women in my age have more than school, and if my family had not been so committed to my education, I would be one of them.
Instead, I meet here proud of college in <unk> College.
When I came back to Afghanistan, my grandfather, the one who was <unk> from her home for the courage to educate his daughters, was one of the first to <unk>
He didn't just get away from my university degree, but also I was in my college degree, and I was the first woman, and I'm the first woman who took him through the streets of Kabul.
My family believes in me.
I would dream big, but my family has even bigger dreams for <unk>
That's why I'm the global ambassador of <unk> a global campaign to educate women.
This is why <unk> <unk> the first and perhaps the only private school for girls in Afghanistan, a country that is still risky for girls to go to school.
The exciting thing is, I see students in my school with the strong desire to leverage opportunity.
And I see their parents and their families who, like my friend, <unk> for them, even though I was even in front of an ideological opposition to it.
As <unk> It's not its real name, and I can't show you his face, but I can't show you his face, but I can't show you a father of one of my students.
Less than a month, he and his daughter went from <unk> to her village, and literally escaped from being killed by a bomb on the way, for minutes.
When you get to your house, they are the phone, a voice <unk> that if he kept sending her daughter to school, they would try.
<unk> now, if he <unk> he said, "but we don't harm the future of my daughter for her old and <unk> ideas."
What I've realized, and this is something that is often very forgotten in the West, is that behind most of the people who were <unk> there is a father who recognized the value of his daughter and he sees that the success of her own success.
It doesn't mean that our mothers have not been key in our success.
In fact, they often are the first compelling <unk> of the brilliant future of their daughters, but in the context of a society like Afghanistan, we need the support of men.
Under the <unk> the girls who went to school they tell in <unk> remember, it was illegal.
But more than three million girls go to school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan looks so different from here in the U.S.
I find that Americans see the fragility of changes.
They would argue that these changes not last long after the retirement troops in the U.S.
But when I go back to Afghanistan, when I look at students in my school and their parents who were <unk> for them, I see the <unk> I see a <unk> future and a <unk>
For me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and possibilities -- and every day the girls of <unk> would be <unk>
Like me, they dream big.
Thank you.
Never forget the words of my grandmother who died in the <unk> <unk> resists <unk> against him.
But you never go back a revolutionary <unk> <unk>
They've spent almost two years since the <unk> revolution was inspired by the <unk> of <unk> massive than the <unk> revolution like <unk>
A forces with many other <unk> citizens inside and out of the country to call a day of anger and initiate a revolution against the <unk> regime of <unk>
And <unk> was a great revolution.
Women and young men <unk> were at the <unk> <unk> each of the regime, by carrying <unk> of freedom, dignity and social justice.
They've shown a lethal courage to face the brutal dictatorship of <unk>
They've shown a great sense of solidarity from the <unk> East, to the west, to the south.
Finally, after a period of six months of brutal war, a few losses from about 50,000 dead, we managed to release our country and overthrowing the <unk>
However, <unk> left a heavy charge, a legacy of <unk> corruption and <unk>
For four decades, the <unk> regime of <unk> destroyed the infrastructure and the moral structure of the <unk> society.
<unk> from the devastation and the challenges, I've loved with a lot of other women, to rebuild civil society <unk> <unk> a <unk> transition and fair towards democracy and national reconciliation to democracy and national reconciliation to democracy and national reconciliation to democracy and national reconciliation to democracy and national reconciliation, national society.
There are about 200 organizations in <unk> <unk> and immediately after the <unk> almost 300 in <unk>
After a period of <unk> years of exile, I went back to Libya and with a single enthusiasm -- I began to organize workshops about the development of capacities and social skills.
With an amazing group of women we founded the Women of women -- <unk> by the <unk> a movement of women, the <unk> <unk> leaders, the <unk> autonomy of the woman and for our right to participation in the building of democracy and peace.
I found myself with a very difficult environment in the period -- an environment that was increasingly <unk> that was <unk> from the selfish policies of domination, and <unk>
Over time, our initiative was won and successful.
Women won a <unk> of the National Congress in the first elections in 52 years.
However, little bit, the exhilaration of elections and the revolution as a whole, were <unk> every day we were working on the news.
One day we woke up with the news of the <unk> of ancient mosques and <unk> <unk>
Another day <unk> with the news of the murder of the American ambassador and the attack on the <unk>
Another day we woke up with the news of the murder of the Army.
And every day, every day we woke up with the government of the <unk> and their <unk> rapes of the human rights and their lack of respect of law.
Our society, made up a psychiatric mindset, and it becomes more <unk> and it has been away from the ideals and principles of freedom, dignity, social justice, that we had at the beginning.
<unk> <unk> and revenge became the icons of the consequences of the revolution.
I'm not here today, at all of us today, with our success story of <unk> <unk> and the election.
Rather, I'm here today to say, as a nation, we choose evil, we take the wrong decision.
We don't prioritize well.
Because elections didn't get peace, and stability and security to Libya.
<unk> list and <unk> between candidates and <unk> brought peace and reconciliation <unk>
No, they didn't.
What happened then?
Why is our society still <unk> and dominated by selfish political policies of domination, and they are both for men as a women?
Perhaps what was missing was not only women, but women value of compassion, mercy and <unk>
Our society needs the national dialogue and the creation of consensus more than what the choices needed to do is just <unk> the polarization and the <unk>
Our nation needs the gender representation of the best of the best of the most important representation of representation and quantitative of it.
We need to stop acting as agents of outrage and call it a few days of anger.
We need to start acting as agents of compassion and mercy.
We need to develop a female discourse -- not only <unk> but also put the mercy in a sense of <unk> the collaboration instead of the competition, the inclusion instead of <unk>
These are the ideals that a Libya, <unk> by war, desperately desperately needs to achieve peace.
Because peace has a <unk> which is about the interrelationship and the <unk> between female perspectives and <unk>
That's the real <unk>
We need to establish that in an existential way before we do it <unk>
According to a <unk> of the Koran <unk> <unk> is the word of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
At the same time, the word <unk> which is known in all the traditions that have the same root in Arabic that the word <unk> <unk> female and <unk> which translates to all of humanity that men and women, that all tribes and all the people have <unk>
And so, just like the uterus completely covers the <unk> that grows inside, the divine matrix of compassion is <unk> all of existence.
This is how it comes to us, "My mercy leads all the things."
This is what it is like, "My <unk> <unk> on my <unk>
They are going to give them the grace of mercy.
Thank you.
I'm here today to talk to you about a distinct question that has an equally <unk> response.
It's about the secrets of domestic violence, and the question I'm going to deal with is the one that they are going to do is that they all make the usual <unk> Why is she left?
Why was someone going to stay with a man who was <unk>
I'm not a psychiatrist, or a social worker, no expert on domestic violence.
I'm just a woman with a story to tell.
I was 22 years old, I had had <unk> at Harvard University.
I had moved to New York City for my first job as a writer and editor in the journal <unk>
I had my first apartment, my first green <unk> American <unk> and I had a very big secret.
My secret was that many, many times, the man, that I was creating my soul, <unk> me to the head with a <unk> loaded with bullets from <unk> <unk>
The man, when I loved anybody in this world, he put a gun in my head and <unk> with <unk> more times than I can remember.
I'm here to tell you the story of <unk> <unk> a passive <unk> <unk> where they fall every year, millions of women, and even some men.
Until it could be his story.
I don't look like a typical survivor of domestic violence.
I'm a <unk> in English at Harvard University, and I have a MBA in <unk> Business <unk>
I've spent the most part of my career working for companies to <unk> <unk> <unk> between them Johnson & Johnson, Leo <unk> and The Washington <unk>
I have almost 20 years married with my second husband and we have three children.
My dog is a black <unk> and lead a <unk> <unk> <unk>
So my first message for you is that domestic violence can happen to anyone, all of races, all religions, all religions, every income levels and education.
It's all over the place.
And my second message is that everybody thinks that domestic violence happens to women, which is a problem of women.
Not exactly.
More than 85 percent of the <unk> are men, and our domestic abuse, just happens in <unk> <unk> and long duration of the families, the last place in families, the last place where we would want or we would expect to find <unk> which is why domestic abuse is so <unk>
I would have told you that it would be the last person in the world who had a man who hits him and actually I was a very typical victim because of my age.
I was 22 years old, and in the United States and the United States women have three times more likely to be victims of domestic violence -- than the other ages, and over 500 women and girls in that age are killed every year by partners, <unk> and husbands <unk> in the United States.
I was also a typical victim because I knew nothing about domestic violence, their warning signals or their patterns.
I met <unk> in a cold and November night of January.
I was sitting next to my side in New York City and he started to <unk> me.
He told me two things.
The first one was that he also had a college <unk> college and I was working on a very important bank of Wall Street.
But what impressed me in that first encounter was that it was ready and fun, and it looked like a field guy.
He had some big <unk> like apples, and a <unk> <unk> and wheat, and it seemed so sweet.
One of the most clever things that did <unk> from the beginning, was to create the illusion that I was the dominant component of a mate.
He did it especially at the beginning, <unk> in a <unk>
We started getting out and loved everything of me -- that I had been to Harvard, who had been to Harvard, who were passionate about helping girls teenagers, and my work.
I wanted to know all about my family, my childhood, my dreams and illusions.
<unk> believed in me, as a writer, and as a woman, as nobody had ever done before.
And it was why I was in that <unk> school and the work on Wall Street and his brilliant future had so much relevance to him.
I didn't know that the first phase in any business of domestic violence is <unk> and <unk> to the victim.
And I didn't know the second step is <unk>
Now, the last thing I wanted to do was to go from New York and leave the work of my dreams, but I thought I had to do sacrifices for your partner, so I decided to quit my work, so I decided to quit my work and <unk> and I went together from Manhattan.
I had no idea that I was falling into a <unk> <unk> who was entering a head in a physical trap and financial and carefully psychological trap.
The next step in the pattern of domestic violence is to introduce violence to see how it reacts to it.
And here it is where those <unk> come in.
And as soon as we moved to New England you know, that place where I was supposed to feel so safe they bought three <unk>
One was in the <unk> of the car.
Another guy kept under the pillow in our bed and the third always in his pocket.
And he said that he needed those guns to cause of a little small age.
I needed them to feel secure.
But those guns were actually a message for me and, although I never had lifted my hand, my life was already serious for a minute of every day.
The first physical attack came up with five days before our wedding.
They were seven in the morning and I still had <unk>
Five days later, when the 10 bruises on my neck had disappeared, I put the girlfriend of my mother and married him.
Despite what had happened, I was sure that we were happy to live forever, because I loved him, and he also wanted me a lot.
And I was very, very <unk>
It was just very <unk> for the wedding and the fact of forming a family with me.
It had been an isolated accident, and I never make it anymore.
I spent two times more on our moon of spreading it.
The first time I was driving up to a secret beach and <unk> and he gave me so strong in the head that I would take on a number of times against the <unk> of the car.
And then, a couple of days later, driving back from our moon of honey, he was blown away by the traffic and threw a Big Mac cold on the face.
<unk> followed by one or twice a week for the next two and a half years of our marriage.
I was excited when I thought it was the only one in this situation.
One of three American women is a victim of domestic violence or employment at some point in their life, and the Center for Disease Control report that every year 15 million children are <unk> 15 million.
So actually, I had a very good company.
Going back to my question: Why would I get <unk>
The answer is straightforward.
I didn't know he was abusing me.
In contrast, I was a very strong woman in love with a profoundly <unk> man, and it was the only person in the world that could help us to face their <unk>
The other question that everybody else is doing is, why don't you just don't get <unk>
Why did I not <unk> I could have been at any time.
For me this is the saddest and painful question that people do, because we are victims, we know something that normally you <unk> is incredibly dangerous to abandon a <unk>
Because the last phase in the pattern of domestic violence is <unk>
Over 70 percent of mass killings in cases of domestic violence occur after the victim has done to the relationship, after <unk> because then the <unk> has nothing to lose.
Other implications include the permanent <unk> even after the <unk> has gone back to marry, <unk> from financial resources, and it manipulation of the family justice system for <unk> to the victim and their children, who normally are forced by judges to spend time not <unk> with the man who <unk> their mother.
And yet we continue to ask why it is simply not going?
I was able to go back to the cause of one last <unk> up to beat my denial.
I realized that the man who loved so much, he would have killed if he was allowed.
So I broke the silence.
I told everyone the world -- to the police, to my neighbors, to my friends and family, to complete strangers, and I'm here today because all of you are <unk>
We have the trend to the victims of the victims as headlines <unk> women and <unk> goods.
The question, "Why is it <unk>
For some people is a way to say "The fault is yours for <unk> as if the victims <unk> intentionally <unk> men who want to <unk>
But since I published <unk> <unk> I've heard hundreds of stories of men and women who were also <unk> who learned a <unk> lesson of what happened to them and that they would raise their lives joyful and happy lives like <unk> wives and mothers, completely free violence, like mine.
Because it turns out I'm actually a victim and a survivor of domestic violence.
I got married with a man cute and kind of and we have those three kids.
I have that black <unk> and I have that <unk>
What you won't go back to have ever more, is a <unk> gun pointing to my head of someone who says that I want.
At this moment, they are thinking, <unk> that is <unk> or <unk> which stupid <unk> but all this time I've actually been talking about you.
I assure you that there are a few people who are listening to me right now, that are being <unk> or they are being <unk> or they were <unk> themselves.
<unk> could be affecting their daughter, to his sister, her best friend right now.
I was able to end my crazy love <unk> breaking the silence.
And I keep doing this today.
It's my way to help other victims, and it's my last request for you.
Talk about what you've heard here.
Money is only in silence.
They have the power to end domestic violence simply throwing light on it.
The victims we need all the world.
We need each of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence.
<unk> the drug to the light talking about it with their children, their friends and family and family.
Do you take your vision of survivors as fantastic people and <unk> who have a future <unk>
<unk> the individual signs of violence to intervene consciously, to stop their climb and show up the victims a safe way."
Together, we can turn our bed, our tables and our families in the <unk> and <unk> they should be.
Thank you.
Hello. I call myself Cameron <unk> and for a while, I'm a model.
To be precise, for 10 years.
And I feel that at this moment, there's a awkward tension in the room because I shouldn't have dressed up like this.  Luckily, I brought up clothes to <unk>
This is the first shift of clothes on a <unk> stage, so you have a lot of <unk> I think.
If some of the women are <unk> when they <unk> you don't have to <unk> now, but I'll find them later on Twitter.
I also want to point out that I have the privilege of being able to change what you think about myself in just 10 seconds.
Not everybody has that opportunity.
These guys are very <unk> less bad than I don't have to use.
The worst part is going to go through this sweater, by the head, because it's when you're going to laugh at me, so you don't do anything while I'm taking my head off.
All right.
Why have I done this?
It's been embarrassing.
Well, I hope not as much as this picture.
The appearance is powerful, but also <unk>
I've changed the whole thing that they thought about me in six seconds.
And in this picture, I had never had a boyfriend, in real life.
I was totally uncomfortable, and the photographer was telling me that I was going to get my back and get my hair out of the kid.
Of course, except with surgery or an artificial tan like the one that I did two days ago for work, there's very little that we can do to transform our appearance, which, although shallow and <unk> has a huge impact on our lives.
So today, to me, being brave means to be honest.
I'm on this stage because I'm a model.
Because I'm a beautiful woman and white, and in my workforce, that's being a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always do, but <unk>
The first question is, how is it going to be a model?
And I always say, <unk> <unk> but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I asked myself is because I won the genetic lottery. And I'm the <unk> of an <unk> and maybe you're wondering what this <unk> is.
Well, in the last centuries we have not only defined beauty as health, youth and symmetry, which are biologically programmed to <unk> we also have associated with a high and <unk> shape to <unk> and a white skin.
And that's my <unk> <unk> I've known to take out to make money.
And I know there are people in the audience who are now shown <unk> and maybe there are some lovers that are <unk> Hold on. There are <unk> <unk> Joan <unk> <unk> <unk>
First of all, <unk> to know so much of models. It's amazing.
But unfortunately I have to report that in 2007, a Ph.D. student at the University of New York, I told all and every single models in the <unk> and the <unk> models -- just <unk> -- less than four percent, they were not white at four percent.
The next question that people always ask me is: Can it be a model when it's <unk>
And my first answer is, I don't know, I don't know that.
But then what I would really tell each of these girls is: why? Can you be what you want.
You can be president of the United States, or the <unk> of the next Internet, or a <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> which would be awesome, because you'd be the first.
If after this list of it, it still <unk> No, no, Cameron, I want to be a model, then I say, "I know my <unk>
Because I'm not in charge of nothing, and you could be the <unk> <unk> <unk> or the <unk> executive director or the next Steven <unk>
To say that most of you want to be model is like saying you want to win the lottery when you're larger.
It's out of your control, it's amazing, and it's not a work you can choose.
I'm going to show you all that I learned in 10 years as a model, because, unlike surgery, <unk> can be summarized right now.
I don't know what happened there.
Unfortunately, once you take your studies, and you have a little job on your backs, whether you have a robot and some jobs on your backs, no matter if you want to be president of the United States, but your robot <unk> Model underwear for 10 years, people would look at you.
The next question that people always do is if all the pictures are <unk>
And yeah, you probably get all the pictures, but that's just a small part of what happens.
And this was the first picture that I showed up, and also the first time I used a <unk> and I didn't even have my time.
I know we're entering the personal field, but it was a child.
So I was wearing my grandmother a few months earlier.
These two pictures are the same day.
My friend came with me.
Here I am at a <unk> party a few days before the French <unk>
Here I am with my football team and in <unk> magazine.
And this is me today.
And I hope you realize I'm not me in those pictures.
They are creations of a professional professionals, <unk> <unk> photographers and <unk> and all their <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and they get to create this. That's not me.
Well, the next question that people always ask me is, do it for free?
I have too many inches from 20 inches and I never use, except for the previous one, but the privilege I get is the ones I get in real life, and we don't like to talk about.
I grew up in Cambridge, and once I went to a store and I forgot to bring money and I forgot for free.
When I was a teenager, I was traveling with my friend who was a <unk> <unk> he jumped on a red light and of course, and of course, <unk> and <unk> a very sorry, agent to be able to keep <unk>
<unk> of these privileges in my appearance, not by my appearance, not what I am. And there are people who are paying a price for their way no matter who they are.
I live in New York City, and last year, from <unk> teenagers who were couple and 86 percent of them were black and Latino and most of them were young men.
And there are only <unk> young black and Latino men in New York City, so for them, it's not a question of <unk>
But how many times do I <unk>
When I was looking for this talk, I found out that for 53 percent of the girls in the United States don't like their body, and that figure takes up to 78 percent to 17.
So the last question that people ask me is: How is this life of a model?
And I think the answer that you expect is, if you're a little bit thinner and you have the most bright hair, you will feel very happy and beautiful.
And behind the cameras, we give an answer that maybe so <unk>
<unk> It's really wonderful to travel, and also incredible power to work with creative people, smart and passionate people.
And that's all true, but it's just a part of what happens, because what we never say in front of the cameras, what I have never said in front of them, is: I'm insecure.
And I'm because I have to worry about me every day.
And if you ever ask yourself, with some more thin legs and the most bright hair will be happier?
They only have to meet with a group of models, because they have the <unk> legs -- the brightest hair and the more to the fashion -- but probably it's probably the most insecure women on the planet.
But mostly it was difficult to analyze a situation of racial oppression and gender when I'm one of the biggest <unk>
If there's something that will hold up from this talk, I hope that everybody will feel more comfortable when you recognize the power of the image in the perception that we have of success and failure.
Thank you.
The photograph has been my passion since it was most enough to support a camera, but I want to share with you my 15 pictures more <unk> and I wasn't me who <unk>
There was no <unk> <unk> no opportunity to repeat the photos, not even a little bit in the lighting in lighting.
In fact, most of the people were taken random tourists.
My story begins when, <unk> in New York City to give a <unk> my wife took me this picture holding my daughter on the day of his first birthday. That's the corner of the 57 and 5.
He happened that we went back to New York City just a year later, so we decided to get the same picture.
Well, you can imagine what's coming now.
When the third birthday of my daughter, my daughter, said, why don't you take a <unk> to New York in a <unk> trip and you drive the <unk>
So here is when we started asking the tourists who were going to get us the picture.
It's amazing that the gesture of delivering the camera to a complete stranger is so universal.
No one has been denied and fortunately, no one has ever been <unk> with the camera.
So we weren't aware of how much life would change this journey.
It became something sacred for us.
This photo is a few weeks after the <unk> and I had to explain to my daughter what had happened that day that a five year-old girl would understand.
These pictures are so much more than representations of a particular moment or a specific journey.
They're also a way to stop time in a week of October and to make it reflect on our time and our evolution over the years, and not just at the physical level, but in every way.
Because even though we always take the same picture, our perspective changes, my daughter, reach new <unk> and I can see life through their eyes and how you perceive and interact with everything.
That particular time we spent together is something that we hope with illusion all year.
Recently, in one of the travel, we were walking, when all of a sudden he stopped in dry and pointed out a red <unk> of the baby store that <unk> little from the previous spectrum.
And it described to me what there was a sense of the five years of foot in that same place.
<unk> who remembered their heart of <unk> with force to see that place for the first time nine years ago.
And now what looks at New York is universities, because it's determined to study in New York City.
And suddenly I understood that one of the most important things that we create is memories.
So I want to share the idea of being active in the conscious creation of memories.
I don't know about you, but apart from these 15 photos, I don't go out of many of the family pictures.
I'm always going to get the picture.
Today I want to encourage everyone today to appear in the picture, and I didn't go back to someone and asked, brings us a picture?
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about a very special group of animals.
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world.
<unk> are in the most famous bird group.
First of all, why do they have so bad <unk>
It's also associated with Disney laughs like <unk> silly characters.
More recently, if you've been following the press <unk> laughter, applause and applause and <unk> these are the attributes that associated with Parliament -- but I don't accept it.
I don't accept it. You know why?
Because the members of Parliament don't have clean the environment.  <unk> don't help prevent the spread of disease.
<unk> are <unk>   Are you far from <unk>  And my favorite, the <unk> have better presence.   There are two kinds of <unk> on this planet.
There are the <unk> of the New World, which are mainly in the <unk> like <unk> and <unk> and <unk> of the Middle World, where we have 16 species. These 16, 11 people face a high risk of extinction.
So why are the <unk> are important -- first of all, provide vital ecological services <unk>
It's our natural garbage <unk>
<unk> the cadavers up to the bone.
They help kill all of the bacteria. They help to absorb the anthrax that not being because of them would spread out and caused large losses from livestock and diseases in other animals.
Recent studies have shown that in areas where there are no <unk> people take three to four times more time in <unk> and this has huge ramifications in the spread of disease.
<unk> also have a huge cultural importance.
They've been associated with ancient culture.
<unk> was the symbol of lip and maternity and, along with the <unk> <unk> the unit between the High High and <unk>
In the mythology of <unk> <unk> was the god <unk> and risked his life to save the <unk> of the Tasmanian devil <unk>
In <unk> culture, they are going to be very important <unk> in the open culture, in places like Tibet, there is no place to bury the dead, or wood to <unk> so these <unk> provide a natural disposal system.
What is the problem with <unk>
We have eight species of <unk> in Kenya, of which six are at extreme <unk> of extinction.
The reason is, they're being <unk> and the reason they're being <unk> is because there are conflict between humans and <unk> <unk> communities use this venom against predators, and as a consequence, the <unk> are victims of this.
In South Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan, four species of <unk> are at the critical list of endangered endangered years, what it means is that in less than 10 or 15 years old, and the reason is because they fall prey from the livestock of livestock that has been treated with a drug <unk> like <unk>
This drug has been banned at the use of India in India and have taken a discussion.
Since there is no <unk> there has been a spread in the number of dogs <unk> in <unk> <unk> and when you have dogs <unk> you have a huge amount of time in order to <unk> the number of anger has dramatically increased in India.
Kenya is going to have one of the biggest wind farms in Africa, <unk> <unk> are going to be above Lake <unk>
I'm not against wind, but we have to work with governments, because wind turbines do this to the birds.
They're <unk> of birds.
In West Africa, there's a horrible trade of <unk> dead to serve <unk> and the <unk> market.
So what are you doing? Well, we're looking at these birds.
We're trying to determine their basic ecology, and see where they go.
We can see that they travel by different countries, so you will focus on a locally problem is not going to serve anything.
We need to work with governments in the <unk>
We're working with local communities.
We're talking to them about appreciating the <unk> about the need to appreciate these wonderful creatures and the services that we have.
How can you help? You can make noise.
When you go out of this room, you're going to tell you about the <unk> but talk to your families, with their children, with their neighbors on the <unk>
They are very <unk> Charles Darwin said he changed the opinion because he saw it fly without the energy energy in the heavens.
Kenya, this world will be much poorest without these wonderful species.
Thank you very much.
Every single thing I run and everything I do <unk> my life has been <unk> for seven years of work during my youth in Africa.
From <unk> to <unk> young people, but I'm not.  I worked in Zambia, Kenya, Costa <unk> and Somalia.
I worked for a <unk> NGO and every project we set up in Africa <unk>
And I was <unk>
I went to the 21, which Italians were good at, and we were doing a good job in Africa.
Instead of all, everything that we would do is <unk>
Our first project, which inspired my first book, <unk> of the <unk> was a project where a few Italians decided to teach people from country to grow food.
So we came up with seeds <unk> south of Zambia on this absolutely amazing valley that goes down to the <unk> River, and we teach local local tomatoes and <unk> and <unk>
Of course, people were not at all interested in doing that, because of what they were trying to come to work, to come to work, and sometimes they didn't get the local --  we were aware that the local in as fertile valley, had had no agriculture.
However, instead of asking how it was possible that we didn't get to <unk> anything, we just said, "Thank God that we're here."  <unk> time to save the people of Zambia on the <unk>
And of course, everything in Africa was <unk>
We got these magnificent <unk> in Italy, a tomato would grow to this size.
And we couldn't believe it, we were telling you to <unk> "Look how easy it is <unk>
When tomatoes were beautiful, <unk> and red, at night to the morning, about 200 <unk> appeared from the river and ate everything.  And we said to the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And the <unk> said, "Yes, that's why we don't have agriculture there."  "Why don't you get it? "You're never going to be <unk>
I thought we were only about it: <unk> mistakes in Africa, but then I saw what Americans did, what they were doing, they were doing the French, and after seeing what they were doing, I was pretty proud of our project in Zambia.
Because, as you can see, at least we feed the <unk>
You can see the <unk>   <unk> to see the waste that we gave them to the <unk> people of Africa.
He wants to read a book, read <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> economist <unk>
The book was published in 2009.
We, Western donors countries, we have given the African continent two million dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you about the damage that the money has <unk>
They just read their book.
<unk> from a African woman -- the damage we've done.
Westerners are <unk> missionaries will be <unk> and we treat people only two things: or the <unk> or we're <unk>
The two words come from the Latin root <unk> which means <unk>
But they mean two different things.
<unk> I deal with any of a different culture as if they were my kids, "I want you a lot."
<unk> I deal with all of a different culture as if they were my <unk>
That's why white in Africa are called <unk> boss.
That book gave me a slap in the face -- "The <unk> <unk> written by <unk> who said about all economic development, if people don't want to be <unk> <unk> alone.
It should be the first principle of aid.
The first principle of aid is <unk>
This morning, the gentleman that opened this conference put a cane on the ground, and he said, we can -- you can -- you can imagine a city that isn't <unk>
I decided to the 27 years to just respond to people, and I invented a system called <unk> <unk> where you never start anything, you will never motivates anyone, but it becomes a <unk> of local passion, the <unk> of the local people who have the dream of becoming a better person.
So what do you? Do you?
It would never come to a community with an idea, and you sit with the people of the <unk>
We don't work from the offices.
We get together in a coffee. We put together in a bar.
We have zero infrastructure.
And what do we do? We become friends, and we found what the person wants to do.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give you an idea to somebody.
If that person doesn't want to do that, what is going to do you?
The passion that she has for its own growth is the most important thing.
The passion that man has for their own personal growth is the most important thing.
And then we helped them find knowledge because nobody in the world can be successful by success.
The person with the idea may not have the knowledge, but knowledge is available.
So years and years ago, I had this idea: Why not we, for once instead of getting to a community to tell people what to do, why don't they do, for one time, they would tell them, but not in <unk> meetings.
Let me tell you a secret.
There's a problem with the <unk>
The entrepreneurs have never been <unk> and they will never tell you in a public meeting, what they want to do with their own money, what opportunity have been <unk>
So, planning has this blind point.
The smartest people in their community, you don't even know about it, because they don't go to their public meetings.
What do we do? We work one to one, and we work on face, you have to create social infrastructure -- which doesn't exist.
You must create a new profession.
<unk> is the family doctor of the company, the medical doctor of business, who sets up with you in your house, at the table of your kitchen, in the coffee, and that helps you find the resources to transform his passion in a way of a living.
I started this as a test in <unk> city of Western Australia.
I was doing a Ph.D. in that time, trying to get away from this exact garbage that we got to tell you what to do.
In one year, I had 27 projects going on, and the government came to see to ask: "How can you do that?
How can you do that? And I said, "I did something very, very hard.
I was going to get them <unk>  So --  So the government says, <unk> <unk>  We have done it in 300 communities in the world.
We've helped to start 40,000 businesses.
There's a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of loneliness.
Peter <unk> one of the greatest business advisers in history, passed away to '96, a few years ago.
Peter <unk> was a professor of philosophy before in the business, and this is what Peter <unk> <unk> is actually incompatible with a society and a company of company <unk>
<unk> is the kiss of the death of the death of business.
So now we take reconstructing reconstructing <unk> without knowing what the most <unk> people in <unk> want to do with their own money and their own energy.
You have to learn how to get these people to talk to you.
You have to give you a sense of privacy, it has to be fantastic to <unk> and then <unk> will come in mass.
In a community of 10,000 people, we got 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people, intelligence and passion?
What are you going to show you more this tomorrow?
local people. That's what you have <unk>
So, what I tell you is that the entrepreneurial spirit is where it is.
We are at the end of the first industrial revolution -- <unk> fossils and one moment to another, we have systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
<unk> as a way to sustain <unk> is not sustainable.
What we have to consider, is how to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to communicate seven billion people, in a sustainable way.
There are no technologies to do it.
Who is going to invent the technology for the green revolution, <unk> <unk>
The government?
They'll be entrepreneurs and they're doing it now.
There's a beautiful story that in a futuristic magazine makes many, many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to discuss the future of New York City in the year <unk>
And in the year <unk> they got together this group of people, and <unk> about what would happen to New York City in 100 years, and the conclusion was <unk> the city of New York wouldn't be within 100 years.
Why? Because they looked at the curve and <unk> if the population is growing up to this <unk> to move to the population of New York to the <unk> <unk> six million horses, and the manure produced by six million horses that would be impossible to address.
They were already <unk> in dung --  So in <unk> they were <unk> this dirty technology that <unk> New York City.
So what happens? Over the next 40 years in 1900, in the United States appeared <unk> generic manufacturers <unk> <unk>
The idea of finding a different technology was absolutely <unk> and there were very few <unk> factories in <unk> places.
<unk> Michigan.
However, there's a secret to work with the entrepreneurs.
First, you have to offer you <unk>
Otherwise, they won't come to talk to you.
Then you have to give you an absolute <unk> dedicated to <unk>
And later you will have to tell the truth about <unk>
The smaller company, the biggest company, the biggest company has to be able to do three things: <unk> the product that you want to sell has to be fantastic, you have to count with a fantastic <unk> and you have to have a great financial administration.
Do you know what?
We have never met a single human being in the world that can make, sell and look for the money alone.
It doesn't exist.
This is still not born.
We have research and looked at the 100 <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- all new companies -- Google <unk>
There's only one thing that all the successful companies in the world have in common, only one was started by one person.
The word was, but the word <unk> 32 times.
He wasn't only when it began.
No one begins a company alone.
So, we can create the community where we have <unk> who come from a small field of small businesses -- on bars with bars and those who are going to do for you, what someone did for this gentleman who talks about this <unk> someone who talks to you, what needs it?
What can you? Can you do it?
Well, you can <unk> you can look at the <unk>
"Oh, no, I can't do that." <unk> looking for <unk>
We activate communities.
Thank you.
People around us can help us from many ways to improve our lives.
We don't know all the neighbors, so we don't spend a lot of knowledge in spite of sharing the same public spaces.
In the last few years I've been trying to share more with my neighbors in the public space, with simple tools like <unk> templates and chalk.
These projects came from questions like, how much pay my neighbors for their <unk>
How can we pay and borrow more things without calling the door at a <unk>
How do you share more memories of our abandoned buildings and understand the best of our <unk>
How do we share more our hopes for cow stores so that our communities can reflect our needs and <unk>
I live in New <unk> and I'm in love with New <unk>
My soul always finds relief with the giant giant <unk> that give <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> for centuries and I trust a city.
It's always going to be supporting music.  There's a <unk> in New York,  The city has one of the most beautiful architecture in the world, but also one of the most beautiful <unk> properties.
I live close to this house and thought how it could turn it into a rather nice space for the neighborhood and also something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost someone who loved a lot.
It was <unk> like a mother to <unk>
Her death was sudden and he was unexpected.
I thought a lot about death and death.
And this led to me a profound gratitude for the lived and time.
It gave him clarity to the significant things of my life.
But I want to keep this look in my everyday life.
I think it's easy to be able to catch up the day and forget the really important thing for you.
So with the help of old and new friends transformed the wall of this abandoned house on a giant board and painted about she sentences for <unk> "Before they die <unk>
So, <unk> could take a <unk> reflect on their lives and sharing personal aspirations in public space.
I didn't know what to expect about this experiment, but the next day the wall was <unk> and still <unk>
And I'd like to share some things that people wrote on the wall.
"Before I die I want to die by <unk>  "Before I die I want to sit on <unk> on the <unk>
"Before I die I want to sing for millions of people."
"Before I die I want to plant a <unk>
"Before I die I want to live out of the <unk>
"Before I die I want to die again one more time.
"Before I die I want to go to rescue rescue.
"Before I die I want to be completely <unk>
This abandoned space became <unk> and the dreams and hopes of people made me laugh <unk> and they gave me comfort in hard times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone. It's about understanding our neighbors in new ways and <unk> -- it's about forcing the reflection and <unk> and remembering what is most important for us as we are growing and <unk>
This happened last year and I started getting hundreds of messages from passionate people who wanted to make a wall in their community.
So with my colleagues at the civic center we made a kit. And now they've been made up in countries in countries like <unk> South Africa, Australia, Argentina and beyond.
And together we showed the power of our public spaces if they give us the opportunity to express ourselves and share each other.
Two of the most valuable things we have is time and our relationships with other people.
In our era of distractions in increasing, it's more important than ever before, to find the ways to preserve the perspective and remember that life is very short and very quickly.
School is something that we often avoid talking or even thinking, but I understood that preparing for death is one of those things that are more power.
And if you think about death -- our life <unk>
Our shared spaces can be able to reflect better what we care about as individuals and as a community and more media to share hope and stories, the people around us cannot only help improve places, can help improve our lives.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I have a single petition.
Please don't tell me that I'm normal.
Now I'd like to introduce you to my brothers.
<unk> is 22 and very <unk>
You don't talk about, but it makes joy better than some of the best speakers.
<unk> knows what love.
It's shared. <unk> happen what's going on.
It's not <unk> You don't look at the color of the skin.
They don't care about religious differences and notice on this: it's never <unk>
When singing songs from our childhood, trying to say the words that I don't even know, I could <unk> it reminds me of one thing, the little thing we know about the mind and how wonderful it must be the unknown.
Samuel is 16 years old. It's very hot.
They were <unk> the most <unk> memory.
However, it's a selective memory.
It doesn't remember if he stole me my <unk> but it reminds me of the year that every of the songs of my iPod, conversations that we kept when I was four years old, and I would sit in my arm during the first episode of the <unk> and <unk> birthday.
It doesn't seem <unk>
But most people don't agree.
And in fact, because their minds are not attached to the concept of society, often they're <unk> and <unk>
But what propelled my heart and <unk> my soul was that even if that was the case -- although you wouldn't consider it within the <unk> that could only mean one thing: they were <unk> autistic and extraordinary.
Now, for those fewer familiar with the term <unk> it's a complex brain disorder that affects social media, learning and sometimes the physical skills.
In each individual it manifests itself in a different way, which is so different to Sam.
And all over the world, every 20 minutes, is being diagnosed with autism, and even though it's one of the development disorders that are faster in the world, there is no cause or <unk>
I don't remember my first encounter with autism, but I don't remember one day without it.
I was just three years ago when my brother came to the world, and I was very excited to have a new being in my life.
When they spent a few months, I realized that he was different.
<unk> a lot.
I didn't want to play like the other babies and, in fact, it didn't seem very interested in me at all.
I lived and <unk> in his own world, with their own rules, and I found pleasure in the smaller things, like putting cars in row around the room, looking at the washing machine and eat anything that was <unk>
As I grew up, it was getting more different, and the differences were made more evident.
But beyond the <unk> the frustration and the <unk> <unk> there was something really <unk> a pure and innocent nature, a child who looked at the world without biases, a human being that there was never <unk>
<unk> <unk>
I can't deny that there have been some difficult moments in my family, moments in which I wish that they were just like me.
But I look back back to the things that have taught me about individuality, the communication and love, and I realize that they're things that wouldn't want to change by normal.
<unk> is going by high the beauty that gives us the differences and the fact of being different doesn't mean that some of you are wrong.
It just means there's a different view of what's right.
If I could <unk> one thing to <unk> and Sam and you would be that you don't have to be normal.
They can be extraordinary.
Because, autistic or not, the differences that <unk> are a <unk> Every one of us has a gift inside and honestly, the pursuit of normal is the last sacrifice of potential.
The opportunity for <unk> the progress and the change is dying at the time when we try to be like others.
Please don't tell me that I'm normal.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I experienced a little bit what has been to be <unk> in the <unk>
Penn State asked me to me, a research teacher who would give a kind of communication to student engineering.
I was scared.  <unk> of truth <unk> from these students with their big minds, his big books and their big words and unknown words.
But when those conversations, I felt what <unk> must have felt when he fell through the hole in the rabbit hole and saw the door of a new world.
I just felt when I had these conversations with the students. They surprised me the ideas they had, and I wanted other people to experience this wonderful world.
And I think the key to open that door is a great communication.
We desperately need a great communication of our scientists and engineers in order to change the world.
Our scientists and engineers are the ones who are attacking our largest challenges from energy to environment and care about the health and care of others, and if we don't know that, the work is not in fact, and I think it's our responsibility as not scientists having these interactions.
But these big conversations cannot happen if our scientists and engineers are not invited to see their wonderful world.
So scientists and engineers, please, <unk> <unk>
I want to share some suggestions about how you can do it to make sure that you can see that your science is sexy and their engineering is attractive.
First question for <unk> and then what?
<unk> why is science relevant to us.
Don't tell us about simply looking at the <unk> but you study the <unk> that are the mesh structure of our bones because it's important to understand and treat <unk>
And when they're describing their science, care of <unk>
<unk> is an obstacle for our understanding of their ideas.
Sure, you can say <unk> and <unk> but why not say <unk> and <unk> which is much more accessible to us?
<unk> accessible is not the same thing as <unk>
Instead, as Einstein, as Einstein, which is just as simple as possible, but it doesn't simple.
They can communicate with clearly your science without engaging the ideas.
One thing to consider is to use examples, stories and analogies -- are ways to hook up with their content.
And when I present your work, forget about the signs of <unk>
Have you wondered why they call <unk>  What do the <unk> <unk> kill and <unk> their presentation.
A <unk> like this is not only boring, but it's been held too much in the area of the language of our brain and we were <unk>
In contrast, this example of <unk> Brown is much more effective, it shows that the special structure of <unk> is so strong that it really inspired the only design of the <unk> <unk>
The trick here is to use a simple quote -- <unk> that the public can understand if you lose a little bit, and then you will provide graphs that will lead to our other senses and create a more profound sense of understanding what they are <unk>
I think these are just some key ones that can help each other open door and see the country of the wonders that science and engineering.
And so scientists and engineers, when you've solved this equation, by all media, <unk> with <unk>  Thank you.
One of my favorite words of all of English English is <unk>
Just because it sounds very well.
And <unk> means <unk> <unk>
Although there was an editor at the 19th century that the very much better defined when he said, "A <unk> is that he searches for a public charge -- no matter of game -- and that, when he wins, you get it through the mere use of a monumental <unk> <unk>
I have no idea what it means <unk>
One of the words, I guess.
It's very important that words are the basis in politics, and that all politicians know that they have to try to master the language.
It was not <unk> for example, <unk> that British Parliament allowed the newspapers to quote the exact words that were said in the <unk> camera.
And all of this was because of the courage of a guy with the unusual name of <unk> <unk> who faced the <unk>
They brought him in the London Tower and he <unk> but he had enough courage to deal with them, and he had such a popular support in London to won.
And only a few years later we had the first use of the phrase <unk> <unk> as well as <unk> <unk> like <unk>
Most of you think it's literal time.
It's not. It's by an advocate of freedom of expression.
But to show you really how words and politics interact, I want you to go back to America right after independence.
So, they had to tackle the question of how to call George Washington, his leader.
You didn't know.
How do you call a leader of a country <unk>
This was <unk> in Congress for a long time.
They introduced all kinds of suggestions that they could have <unk>
Some wanted to call it <unk> <unk> and others, "Your <unk> George <unk> and other <unk> of the <unk> of the American <unk>
Not very <unk>
Some of them simply wanted to call it <unk>
They thought it was <unk>
And they didn't even have the idea that you could be elected King for a given piece of time.
And there might be <unk>
Everybody got tired <unk> because this debate was <unk> for three weeks.
I read the newspaper from a poor <unk> and always <unk> <unk> with this <unk>
What caused the <unk> and the <unk> was that the House of <unk> was against the <unk>
The House of Representatives didn't want Washington to become power.
They didn't want to call him King for if he gave him to his old ideas.
So they wanted to give the most <unk> title and more <unk> <unk>
And that title was <unk>
President. I didn't invent the title.
It was like the president of a jury.
And I didn't have a lot more <unk> than the term <unk> or <unk>
There were <unk> presidents were <unk> <unk> and <unk> of government, but it was really a title, <unk>
And so the Senate is <unk>
They said, "It's ridiculous, we can't call it <unk>
"This guy has to sign treated and meet <unk> <unk>
"And who will take a serious title with a <unk> <unk> <unk>
And finally, after three weeks of debate, the Senate didn't <unk>
We can learn three interesting things about this.
First of all, and this is my favorite, until I have been able to figure out, the Senate has never been <unk> for the President.
President Barack Obama is lucky enough to keep there, waiting for the Senate in action.
The second thing that we can learn is that when a government tells you that a measure is <unk>  <unk> possible to keep us for <unk> more.
But the third thing that we can learn, and this is the most important thing, and this is the most important, and I want to tell you, is that the headline of President of America doesn't sound so modest today, right?
Especially if you have more than 5,000 nuclear warheads -- the largest economy of the world and a fleet of air and air vehicles and so on.
The reality and history have endowed with the title of <unk>
So ultimately I won the <unk>
They got their title of <unk>
And also the other concern in the Senate, appearance as well, it was a uniqueness then.
But you know how many nations have now <unk>
And everything because they want to sound like the guy who has the 5,000 nuclear warheads and so on.
So, at the end of the Senate won and the House of <unk> <unk> because no one is going to feel humble when you tell you that now are the President of <unk>
And I think that's the great lesson that we can learn, and what I would like to do with you.
The politicians are trying to choose and use the words to shape and control reality, but really, really changes the words that what they might change reality.
Thank you very much.
I'm 45 to under the land in a illegal mine in Ghana.
The air is loaded with heat and dust and it's hard to breathe.
I feel the touch of <unk> bodies in the dark, but I can't see much more.
I hear the voices that they talk about, but most of all, that cacophony of male <unk> and rocks <unk> with primitive.
As others, I take a cheap little bit of light <unk> she holds your head with this <unk> <unk> and I can barely tell the <unk> the branches that hold the walls of that hole in a meter like a hundred feet on the ground.
He <unk> my hand and suddenly I remember a <unk> that I met before, who lost the control and the <unk> feet on that toilet.
As I talk to you today, these men are in the deep part of that hole to risk their lives without paying a reward and often, they dying.
I went out of that hole and I went home, but they might never do it because they're prey to <unk>
In the last 28 years, I was documenting native cultures in the middle of 70 countries in six continents, and in 2009, I had the great honor of being the only <unk> in the Peace <unk>
Among all the amazing people I met there, I met the <unk> of <unk> the <unk> an NGO who is dedicated to eradicate modern slavery.
We started talking about slavery and, actually, I started learning about slavery because I knew that there was in the world but not a degree.
When we ended up talking very sad, I honestly was <unk> to ignore this <unk> of our days and I thought, if I don't know, how many people don't know?
He made me <unk> the stomach and weeks later, I flew to Los Angeles to meet the director of <unk> the <unk> and offer my help.
So my journey started my journey to modern slavery.
Interestingly, I had been in many of these sites.
Some of you can even be considered my second home.
But this time, <unk> the dirty <unk>
A conservative calculation says that there are now over 27 million people in the world.
It's twice as much as the number of Africans displaced throughout the entire slave slave
150 years ago, the cost of a farmer slave was about three times the annual salary from a U.S. worker.
The equivalent of a <unk> of <unk>
However, you can take whole families to entire families for generations per <unk> <unk>
Amazingly, slavery generates revenues from over <unk> billion <unk> a year around the world.
Many of you have been <unk> with false <unk> promises of good education and better work to find out that they are forced to work without pay, under threat to violence and cannot escape.
Today slavery operates in <unk> the capital produced by slaves they have value, but those who produce them are disposable them.
<unk> exists in almost everyone and yet it's illegal around the world.
In India and Nepal, I met the brick blast <unk>
This strange, exciting show was like entering the old Egypt or the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> on a temperature of 54 degrees C, men, women, children, in fact, extended entire families -- in a heavy <unk> cloak in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in their head, to 18 at the time, and they take them from <unk> <unk> to trucks that are at hundreds of feet.
<unk> by <unk> and <unk> work in silence, doing this task again and again for 16 hours a day.
There was no coffee coffee, or not to drink, and the severe <unk> I was just quite <unk>
So <unk> were the heat and the dust that my camera was got too hot to the same and she stopped working.
Every 20 minutes I had to run the car to clean up the team and make it work with air conditioning and <unk> and sitting there, I was thinking, my camera gets a much better treatment better than these people.
Back in <unk> I wanted to cry but the <unk> that I was on my side quickly grabbed me and said, <unk> not <unk> Don't do it here."
And explained to me very clearly to demonstrate emotions is very dangerous in places like this, not just for me but for them.
I couldn't offer any direct help.
I couldn't give them money, nothing.
I was not the citizenship of that country.
I could put them in a worse situation than they already were.
I had to rely on <unk> the <unk> and working within the system for her release and trusted which I would read it.
As soon as I waited to get home to feel my heart <unk>
In the Himalayas I found children dragging stones for miles per <unk> <unk> to trucks they were waiting down.
Those big <unk> were more heavy than the kids who charge and the kids were sending them to their heads with <unk> <unk> made of <unk> ropes and <unk>
It's hard to witness something that <unk>
How can we influence something so <unk> but so <unk>
Some people don't even know they're slaves -- and they work 16 -- 17 hours a day without <unk> because this has been this whole life.
They have nothing to <unk>
When these villagers were <unk> their freedom, they had <unk> <unk>
When you hear the word slavery often we think of sexual trafficking, we often think of sexual traffic and because of this global consciousness advised me that it would be difficult for me to work with security in this particular business.
In <unk> I was <unk> women who had been previously sexually <unk>
They drove me through the stairs <unk> that gave this <unk> <unk> <unk> light.
It wasn't exactly a <unk>
It was a restaurant.
<unk> as it knows in the craft, they are local for prostitution itself.
They have small rooms -- private rooms -- where <unk> <unk> with their girls and children, some of them just seven years -- are forced to entertain customers and to buy more food and alcohol.
Every place is dark and <unk> identified by a number painted on the wall and divided by a <unk> and a curtain.
The workers often suffer sexual abuse of their customers.
From the <unk> I remember making sense of a <unk> <unk> fear -- and in that minute, I barely could imagine what should be stuck in that hell.
I had only one <unk> the stairs where they were <unk>
There was no <unk>
There were no windows as big enough to <unk>
Those people don't have <unk> and, because they touch a very difficult issue, it's important to point out that slavery, even the sexual trafficking, happens to us.
There are hundreds of people in the agriculture, in <unk> in the domestic service, and the list can continue.
Recently, the New York Times reported that between 100,000 children and 300,000 children are sold every year as sex.
It's everywhere, but we don't see it.
<unk> are another activity that often relate to <unk> labor.
I went to Indian villages in which there was entire families -- <unk> in the trade of silk.
This is a family <unk>
The black hands of black hands are from the father, the <unk> of blue and red, of their children.
<unk> <unk> in these big barrels and <unk> silk into the liquid to the <unk> but <unk> is <unk>
My performer told me his stories.
We don't have <unk> they said.
We still hope, however, be able to get out of this house someday and go to another place where we really pay our job."
It's estimated that there are more than 4,000 children in the Lake <unk> the largest artificial lake in the world.
When we arrived, I was going to take a look at a quick look.
I saw what seemed to be a fishermen of fishermen on a boat, two older brothers -- some younger brothers -- makes sense, right?
<unk> They were all slaves.
Children are separated from their families <unk> <unk> and they forced them to work <unk> long in these boats in the lake, despite knowing how to swim.
This child is eight years old.
When our boat came up to me was a little bit <unk> that his little canoe was <unk>
I was paralyzed by the fear of falling into the water.
<unk> branches of trees plunged into Lake <unk> and they often catch networks and children, <unk> and fear is thrown into water to unlock the branches.
A lot of <unk>
Since remember, it's always been forced to work on the lake.
For fear of his love is not going to run up and, like all life has been treated with cruelty, cruelty, it tries to be younger slaves under their charge.
I met these guys at five o'clock in the morning, when I was going to get the last networks, but they had been working on the time.
It was cold and <unk>
And it will point out that these networks weigh over 400 pounds when they're packed with fish.
I want to introduce you to <unk>
Kofi was rescued in a village of fishermen.
I met him in a refuge where the <unk> <unk> the victims of slavery.
Kofi symbolizes it as possible.
Who will come to be because someone decided to make the difference in your life?
<unk> by a road in Ghana with <unk> partners -- the <unk> a fellow <unk> with his <unk> suddenly accelerated and <unk> our car and played the window.
It asked us to take it through a road of land to the jungle.
At the end of the way, we were able to get out of the car, and he asked the driver to come out very quickly.
Then you signal this path barely visible and said, "This is the path, this is the road.
As we started down, we removed the <unk> and after walking close to an hour we found that the road was <unk> by the recent <unk> so I put the photos of photos on my head as I put in these waters to the chest.
After two hours of <unk> the <unk> path ended up <unk> in a clear, and we had a mass of holes that could fit into a football field, and they were all filled with <unk> workers.
A lot of women had children tied up to their backs and while they were looking for gold, <unk> in waters <unk>
<unk> is used in the <unk> process.
These <unk> are <unk> in a well in another part of Ghana.
When they came out of the pump were <unk> in your own sweat.
I remember looking at his eyes tired, <unk> because many had been under land for 72 hours.
The pits have to be 90 feet and these people carry up heavy stone bags that then will be shipped back to another area where I would draw the stone to be able to extract the gold.
In the first view, the site seems to be filled with strong men and <unk> but if we look closer, the margin we see is working on other <unk> and also children.
They're all victims of injuries, diseases and violence.
In fact, it's very likely that this <unk> will end up as this victim of tuberculosis and <unk> for mercury in a few years.
This is <unk> When his father died his uncle took him to work with him in mines.
When they died their uncle, they <unk> it is the debt of the uncle that will be a slave in mines.
When I met him, he had worked in 14 years and the leg injury that you see here is a product of a accident in the <unk> so severe that doctors said it should be <unk>
In addition to that, <unk> has tuberculosis, and yet, to that, it's forced to work at night and day in that mine.
And yet, he dream is going to be liberated and <unk> with local activists like <unk> the <unk> and it's this kind of determination, in the face of a remote, which inspires me a lot of respect.
I want to throw light on the <unk>
They knew that their images would be seen by you all over the world.
I wanted you to know that we'll be testament to them and we'll do everything possible to help change their lives.
I really believe that if we can look at each other as human beings, then it makes it very difficult to tolerate atrocities like slavery.
These images are not from magazines. They are people, and real people, like you and like me, who deserve the same rights, dignity and respect in their lives.
There's no day that I think I don't think of these so many beautiful people that I've had the great honor I knew about.
I hope that these images wake up a force in which you see them in people like you, and I hope that force turns out a fire and that fire <unk> light on slavery because, without that light, the beast of slavery can continue to live in the shadows.
Thank you very much.
I make mathematical math and there is a peculiar problem for the <unk> we are like the management facility.
Nobody knows what the hell we do.
So today I'm going to try to explain to you what I do.
Dance is one of the most human activities.
We were going to tell us the <unk> of the ballet and the dancers of <unk>  that we'll see later.
But the nucleus demand a degree of extraordinary training, a high level of skill and probably a <unk> initial <unk> that can well have a genetic component.
Unfortunately, the neurological disorders like Parkinson's Parkinson's -- destroy this extraordinary ability as it does with my friend <unk> <unk> which, at the time, was a brilliant ballet dancer dance.
In the last few years, it has made a lot in the treatment.
However, there are <unk> millions of people in the world who are sick, and they have to deal with a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and other symptoms of this disease, so we need tools to use them to detect the disease before it's too late.
We need to be able to measure progress in an objective way, and ultimately, the only way we know if we actually have a cure for being when we have an objective measure and <unk>
But it's frustrating that for Parkinson's and other disorders of the movement are not being <unk> so they don't serve blood analysis, and the best we have is a neurological test for 20 minutes.
You have to go to a clinic to do this. It's very, very expensive, and that means that outside the clinical trials, they never do.
What if patients could do it at home?
That would save a trip to the clinic. What if patients could do ourselves?
It would not be personal.
By the way, it costs about 300 dollars in the <unk> clinic.
So what I want to do is, as a conventional form of a try, you can see, in some sense at least we are <unk> like my friend <unk> <unk>
This is a video of the vibration of vibrating strings.
It shows someone healthy while it emits sounds like this, and we can imagine as dancers of a vocal voice, because we need to coordinate all those vocal organs to produce sounds and all of us have the genes needed -- the <unk> for example.
And as though <unk> requires an extraordinary training.
Let's think about time that brings a child to learn to speak.
From the sound, we can track the position of vocal ropes as they are, and as well as Parkinson's affects the <unk> it also affects the <unk> organs.
On the bottom line you can see a <unk> <unk> of string strings.
We see the same <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
The speech becomes more quiet and <unk> after a while, and this is an example of the symptoms.
How do they compare these exams based on the voice with the clinical trials -- well, they're both not <unk>
The neurological test is not <unk> both using existing infrastructure.
You don't need to design a whole series of hospitals to make them.
Both of them are <unk> OK, but in addition to the exams that are not <unk>
I mean, they can be <unk>
They do very quickly, take about 30 seconds like a lot.
They are at minimal cost, and we all know what happens.
When something takes a cost so <unk> it appears on a massive scale.
These are some incredible goals to address.
We can reduce the medical difficulties to patients.
I don't need to go to the clinic for the follow-up <unk>
<unk> <unk> we could get objective data.
We could do a mass of under cost for clinical trials, and for the first time, <unk> <unk> at a general scale.
We have the opportunity to start looking for the first <unk> of disease before it's too late.
So when you give the first steps in that sense, we're launching the Parkinson's <unk>
And back to <unk> and <unk> we want to record a lot of voices around the world to collect enough data and start to address these goals.
We have local lines for about 750 million people in the world.
<unk> with <unk> or <unk> can call under price and put recordings for a few cents. And I'm pleased to announce that we've already reached six percent of the goal in only eight hours.
Thank you.   Tom Rielly: So let's take it out, taking all of these samples of, let's say 10,000 people, you'll be able to say who is healthy and who doesn't?
What about these <unk>
Max <unk> Yeah, yes. What happens is that during the call you have to indicate if you have or not the disease. TR: Sure.
<unk> You can see, some people can do not <unk> You may not get it.
But we're going to get a very big sample of data in different circumstances, and doing it in different circumstances is important because we're looking at <unk> the confusion factors in search of the real <unk>
TR: They have a accuracy of precision at this point?
<unk> A lot more than that.
And actually, my graduate student, I have to <unk> has done a fantastic job, and now it has shown that it works on the mobile phone network as well, what we would do the project. We now have a 99 percent accuracy.
TR: <unk> and nine. Well, it's a improvement.
<unk> Absolutely.
TR: Thank you very much. Max <unk> public.
<unk> Thank you, <unk>
Before March of 2011, I was doing <unk> <unk> in New York City.
We're <unk> creatures.
We will spread in the darkness, in no windows without windows and large, we avoid sunlight.
We do the fine models that are still more <unk> the perfect skin we do, and we are doing it in the press all the time, but some of us are really artists with talent with many years of experience and a real taste of the images and the photograph.
On March 11, 2011, I saw from my house, as the rest of the world, the <unk> events that was happening in Japan.
Little time later, an organization where I was <unk> there was a <unk> in the room working as part of the answer.
And next with hundreds of other volunteers we knew that we couldn't stay sitting at home, so I decided to join the group for three weeks.
The 13 of May traveled to <unk>
It's a little <unk> village located in the <unk> of <unk> of almost 50,000 people, one of the first people affected by the wave.
Water level reaches over 24 feet tall and more than three kilometers land.
As you can imagine, the people were <unk>
<unk> rubble from the channels and the <unk>
<unk> schools removed the mud and we leave the houses to be <unk> and <unk>
We took tons and tons of <unk> fish, <unk> from the local factory.
We were <unk> and we loved it.
For weeks, both volunteers like neighbors found similar things.
They found pictures and photos of photos and cameras and <unk> cards.
Everyone did the same thing.
<unk> and bring them to different places of the villages around <unk>
It wasn't until I realized that those pictures represented a huge part of personal losses that people had <unk>
As they were fleeing the wave, and to save their lives, they had to abandon absolutely everything they had.
At the end of my first week, I started to help in a <unk> center of the town.
It helped clean the <unk> <unk> big, gigantic <unk>
This place turned out to be in addition to the village where the <unk> center is <unk> the photos.
And I had the honor of it and I had the honor that it was <unk> in me to clean up the photos.
This was exciting and inspiring, had heard the expression beyond the <unk> but it wasn't until I moved beyond my horizons that something happened.
When you look at the pictures, I found some that had over a hundred years, some of them were still in the lab on the lab, and I couldn't avoid thinking about how to fix that <unk> and repair that <unk> and I knew hundreds of people who could do the same.
So that night I went on to Facebook contacted some of them, and the next morning the answer was so overwhelming and positive and I knew we had to try.
So we started <unk> the photos.
This was the first of all.
It wasn't too <unk> but where the water had <unk> the face of the girl, I had to have a lot of precision and <unk>
In another way, that little girl would not have the aspect of it, and that would be as tragic as having the photo <unk>
Over the time of time, they came by luck more photos and they needed more <unk> so I got into Facebook and <unk> and five days later 80 people in 12 countries volunteered to help.
Within two weeks I had 150 people <unk>
In Japan, July, in July, we were <unk> a village to Northern <unk>
Once a week, we use our scanner in the libraries in the libraries that had been <unk> where people were going to reclaim their photos.
And the time that you were doing in <unk> is a different story, it depended on the <unk> of the photos.
It could be an hour. It could be weeks ago.
It could make months.
This <unk> had to draw pretty much by hand using a guide <unk> the areas whose color and detail was not destroyed.
It took a long time.
The water destroyed all of these pictures that are consumed by saltwater covered in bacteria, with algae, and even with oil -- all of it along with the time I continue to <unk> by that hand <unk> was a major part of the project.
We couldn't afford the picture unless it was clean <unk> and it would have been <unk> by his <unk>
We were lucky with <unk> by hand.
We have a <unk> with a <unk>
It's very easy to harm even more the photos already <unk>
As I once said, the leader of my group is like making a tattoo.
You can't make mistakes.
The woman who brought us these photos were lucky to the photos.
He had started <unk> her same but stopped when they realize that the <unk> even more.
He also had <unk>
Without them, the images of her own husband and his own face would not have been able to <unk> we were able to put the images into a single picture and <unk> the whole picture.
When they picked up their photos shared something of his story with us.
Some colleagues of her husband found photos in a fire station between the rubble -- quite far from where she used to be his house, but his colleagues would get it.
The day of the tsunami, his husband was the experimenter to close the barriers to the wave.
He had to go inside the water while the <unk> <unk>
Their children smaller, not so small now, but their two children were in school, in different schools.
One of them was trapped in the water.
It took a week to find her entire family and know that everybody was survived.
The day I gave her a little child her child at the age of 14 years.
For her, despite all of this, those pictures were the best gift I could <unk> something that he could go back to you, something that he could remember from the past that he didn't have been published by that day of March when everything in his life changed or was destroyed.
After six months in Japan 1,100 volunteers had joined up with <unk> hundreds of them helped us clean up to the <unk> of <unk> photographs, the great majority -- the vast majority of them became the hands of their <unk>
More than 500 volunteers all over the world helped us to bring back 90 families from totally <unk> and <unk>
During this time, we don't really spend a thousand in teams and a materials, and most of them in ink for <unk>
We take pictures all the time.
One photo is a memory of someone or something, one thing, somebody loved it.
They are <unk> of our memories and stories, the last thing we would take but the first thing that we would take look for.
What about this project was to restore small pieces of humanity, to return to someone your connection to the past.
When a picture like this, give someone, a huge difference in the life of the person that comes in.
This project also made a great difference in the life of <unk>
Some of them connected to something bigger with something bigger -- using their talent to something that are not going to be any standard of perfect skin.
To finish my email I'd like to read this email that I was sent back from Japan after six months.
As I <unk> I couldn't help but think about people and the stories shown in the images.
One particular photo was a photo with women from different ages from the grandmother to the young girl, gathering around a baby, <unk> a baby, <unk> because a similar picture of my family my grandmother, my mother, and my newborn daughter hangs out of our wall.
In the whole world, in all of our basic needs are the <unk> right?
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> inspired us to ask wonder and curiosity with this picture of a bullet coming through an apple on an exhibition on one millionth of a second.
But now, 50 years later, we can go over a million times faster and see the world not a million or a billion frames per second.
Let me introduce you to a new type of <unk> the <unk> a new technique that can create videos in slow motion in motion.
And with that we can create cameras that can see behind the <unk> beyond the line of vision, or seeing the inside of the body without using X-rays, and challenge the camera idea.
If I take a laser pointer and switch it up, and you turn it into a <unk> of second or that, in various <unk> to create a photons of photons from just a millimeter wide <unk>
And that package of photons, that <unk> will travel to the speed of light, and again, a million times faster than a common bullet does.
If we took that bullet and this package of photons and <unk> in this bottle, how do those photons spread inside this <unk>
What is the light aspect of the light in <unk>
Now, all of this --   Remember, all of this is happening in less than a <unk> is what it takes to travel the light.
But this video is 10 billion times slower so you can see light in motion.
Coca-Cola is not <unk> this research   <unk> a lot of things in this <unk> <unk> this information to show what's going on.
The pulse, our <unk> goes into the bottle with a package of photons that starts to <unk> and that, inside, it starts to <unk>
Part of the light is <unk> it goes to the table, and we started to see these <unk>
A lot of photons finally get to the lid and then explode in various directions.
As you can see, there's a air bubble that bounces inside the inside.
At that time, the waves travel on the table and because of the insights to the top of the top you see in the bottom of the bottle, after several boxes, that the insights were <unk>
Now, if we take a common and current bullet and we make it go down the same distance and see it in slow camera, about 10 billion times, how much you think it would take us to sit down to see that movie?
One day?
It would be a very boring movie --  of a bullet moving in motion.
And how about <unk> <unk>
You can see the waves coming out of the table, the tomato wall and the wall.
It's like throwing a stone into a pond.
It's the way that nature paints a picture, I thought of a <unk> at the time, but of course, our eyes see a full composition of it.
But if you look at once more <unk> you'll realize that, as the light was thrown out of the tomato <unk>
Why? Because the tomato is <unk> and the light bounces on its inside and it goes back and forth after several <unk> of a second.
In the future, when this <unk> is in your phone, you're going to be able to go to the supermarket and check if the fruit is grown without having to <unk>
So why do we create this camera at TED.
As photographers, you know, if you take a <unk> <unk> it goes very little light.
But we will go to a billion times faster than the shortest exposure -- so you just get into some light.
So we sent that <unk> that package of photons, millions of times, and we recorded one and again with a very <unk> <unk> we took those <unk> of data and <unk> <unk> to create those <unk> that I showed you.
We can take all of those data in raw and <unk> in an interesting way.
Superman can fly.
Other heroes can become invisible, they can get invisible.
And if a new power of a future would allow him to see after the <unk>
The idea is that we could throw some light on the door, and you get into the room, one part is going to reflect on the door, and from there to the camera.
Where we could extract those multiple light bulbs.
It's not science fiction. We have already built.
On the left, it's our <unk>
Behind the wall is a <unk> and <unk> the light on the door.
After the publication of our article in Nature <unk>
And a small fraction of the photons go back to the camera, but interestingly, slightly different.
And as we have a camera that works so fast, our <unk> has unique capability.
It has very good temporary resolution and you can look at the world at the speed of light.
So we know the distances all the way up to the door, and also to the hidden objects, but we don't know what point it is going to be.
So by projecting a laser can record a picture of <unk> which, you see on the screen, it doesn't really make any sense.
But we will take a lot of images like this, dozens of images, the <unk> and we're going to try to analyze the multiple <unk> of light, and with that, we will be able to see the <unk> object.
Can we see it in <unk>
This is our reconstruction here.
We have things to explore before we get this lab, but in the future, we could create cars that <unk> <unk> with what's going on on the curve, and we have a <unk>
Or we could look for survivors in dangerous conditions by looking at light as reflected by open windows on the way.
Or could we build <unk> able to see inside of the body through <unk> and the same for the <unk>
But of course, because of the tissue and blood this is pretty hard, so actually this is a request for scientists to start thinking about <unk> as a new model of visualization to solve the problems of mammography in the next generation.
So as <unk> <unk> he was a scientist, I became the science of art, a art of photographs <unk>
I realized that all of the data data that we collect every time is not just for scientific visualizations but we can see it.
It will create a new form of computer photograph with slow motion and color code.
And let's look at those waves and remember the time between each of those waves is just a few <unk>
But here's something that's fun.
If you look at the waves under the <unk> these are going on us.
The waves should move to us.
What happens here?
Turns out, as we're recording almost at the speed of light, we have strange effects -- Einstein would have loved to see this image.
The order in which events happen in the world sometimes appears to be invested in the camera.
We have the corresponding warping of space and time, we can correct this <unk>
It's time. Thank you.
Hello. This is my mobile phone.
A mobile phone can <unk> life, and gives you individual freedom.
With a mobile phone can <unk> a crime against humanity in Syria.
With a mobile phone you can tweet a message and start a protest in Egypt.
With a mobile phone, you can record a song, you get it to <unk> and get famous.
This is all possible with a cell phone.
I'm a <unk> of 1984 and I live in the city of <unk>
Let's go back to that moment, to this town.
So here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people were going to have a change.
This is the fall of 1989. Imagine if all of these people gathering that they were looking for a change, had a cell phone in our pocket.
Who on the age have a cell phone here?
<unk>
Raise your mobile phone, <unk>
<unk> A Android, <unk>
It's a lot. Almost everyone today has a cell phone.
But today I'm going to talk about my phone, and how it changed my life.
I'll talk about this.
These are 35 <unk> of information.
databases.
Why is that information there?
Because in the summer of 2006, the E.U. Commission presented a <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
This directive says that every single mobile company, every single market provider in Europe, has to store a wide range of information from users.
Who calls <unk> Who sends a email to <unk>
Who's sent to <unk>
And if we use the phone, where we are.
All of this information is stored for at least six months, and to two years, in their phone company or their <unk>
And in all Europe, people stood up and said, "We don't want this."
They said they didn't want this <unk>
We want the <unk> in the digital age, and we don't want the carriers and the Internet providers -- all this information about us.
There was lawyers, the journalists, priests, priests, all of them said, "We don't want this."
And here you can see about 10,000 people who came out to the streets of Berlin and they said, <unk> not <unk>
And some of them even said this would be <unk> 2.0.
The <unk> was the secret police of East Europe.
And I also wondered if this really works.
Can you store all this information about us?
Every time I use the <unk>
So I asked my phone -- <unk> <unk> who was at that time was the largest telephone company in Germany, which is why I was doing all the information they had about me.
I asked them once, and I went back to them, and I didn't get a concrete answer -- it was all <unk>
But then I said, I want to have this information because you are <unk> my life.
So I decided to get a court for court because I wanted to have this information.
But <unk> <unk> said no, we will give you this information.
At the end of the end, I was <unk>
And they would take the demand and they would send me the information that I <unk>
Meanwhile, the Veterans' Court <unk> failed the <unk> for the German law of the E.U.
So I got this ugly <unk> on a CD in the inside.
And on the CD there was this.
Thirty thousand <unk> and five thousand <unk>
When I first saw it, I said, well, it's a huge archive OK.
But after a while, I realized that it's my life.
There's six months of my life on this archive.
It was a bit <unk> what should I do with that?
Because you can see where I am, where I step at night, what am I doing.
But then I said, I want this information <unk>
I want to make it public.
Because I want to show people what the data <unk> means.
So next to <unk> <unk> and Open Data City, we did this.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can zoom in, and you're going to go back and forward.
You can see every step I give you.
And you can see what I'm going to see in the train to <unk> and how often I call it in the way.
This is all possible with this information.
That gives a little scary.
But it's not just about me.
But all of us.
First, there are things like, I call my wife and she calls me a couple of times.
Then they call me some friends and they call each other.
And then one calls the other, and the other one another, and we end up with this great network of communication.
You can see how your people communicate to what time they call each other to what time they go to sleep.
You can see all this.
You can see the centers, the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what's doing the society.
If you have access to this information, you can control their society.
This is a model for countries like China and Iran.
This is a model to study the shape of your society, because you know who speaks to whom, who sends an email to whom, all of this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored at least six months in Europe, to two years.
As I said at the beginning, imagine if all these people in the streets of Berlin, in the fall of 1989, they had a cell phone in our pocket.
And the <unk> had known who was involved in this protest, and if the <unk> had known who the leaders had never happened.
The fall of the Berlin Wall of Berlin might never have happened.
And as a result, even the <unk> of <unk>
Because today the state agencies and companies want to store so much information from us as possible within and out of the web.
They want to have the ability to follow our lives and they want to keep them forever.
But <unk> and living in the digital was not a contradiction.
But today you have to fight the <unk>
You have to fight for that every day.
When they go home to their friends that privacy is a value of the 21st century, and it's not very well.
When you're going to go home, you know, his representative that only because companies and state agencies can store some information, they don't have to do it.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company, what can you store from you.
So in the future, every time you use their mobile phones to take them to remember that they have to fight for the <unk> in the digital era.
Thank you.
Hello, TEDWomen, what happens?
It's not enough.
Hello, TEDWomen, what happens?
I call myself <unk> <unk> and I'm not <unk> but I know the doctor that brought me into the world.
I want my mom six times in six different directions -- <unk> to the poor of me in the process.
As a result, I have cerebral palsy, and so they <unk> all the time.
<unk>
It's <unk> I'm like a mixture of <unk>
And Muhammad <unk>
The P. C. is not genetics.
It's not <unk> it can't be <unk>
No one <unk> the uterus -- my mother and not <unk> because my parents were cousins, too.
It's just about accidents, like the one that happened to birth.
Now, I'm going to tell you, I'm not a source of inspiration and I don't want any of those in this room.
I feel bad for me, because at some point in life, you've wanted to be a disabled person.
Let's go for a walk.
<unk> at Christmas, they are at the shopping center, drive in circles and <unk> and what do you see?
16 empty places for disabled places.
And they think, "God, I can be at least a little <unk>
In addition, I mean, I have 99 problems, and the P. C. is just one of them.
There was a golden medal.
I'm <unk> Muslim and a woman, live in New Jersey.
If you don't feel better, maybe you should do it.
I am from Park <unk> in New Jersey.
I always loved that my neighborhood and my disease had the same initial ones.
I also love that if I want to walk from my home to New York, I would.
A lot of people with cerebral <unk> not <unk> but my parents don't believe in the puede" moment.
The mantra of my father was, "Can you <unk> <unk> <unk>
If my three senior sisters were <unk>
If my three senior sisters went to public school, my parents would go to public school, my parents would go to the school system, and I would agree that I was going, and if we didn't take all the top note -- all the <unk> of my mother.
My father taught me to walk five years to put my <unk> in his feet and just walking.
Another breakthrough that I used was hang on a dollar in front of me so that it was <unk>
The <unk> that I carry on was very loud and ...
Yeah. The first day in the kindergarten was walking as a computer champion who has received a lot of taps.
Growing up, there were only six Arabs in my city and they were all of the family.
Now there are 20 Arabic and they continue to be all of the family.  I think nobody realized that we weren't <unk>
This was before 9/11 and the politicians would think appropriate to use <unk> to the <unk> as a campaign motto
The people I grew up had a problem with my faith.
However, it seemed to be <unk> a lot of death dying during the <unk>
I told them that he had enough fat to live three months without eating it, so I just <unk> at dawn at sunset very easy.
<unk> <unk> in <unk>
Yes, in <unk> I'm crazy.  My parents could not pay the physical therapy, so they sent me to the dance school.
I learned to dance with <unk> or whatever I can walk with <unk>
I'm from New Jersey, and we want to be <unk> so if my friends were using <unk> I too.
And when my friends were going to go through summer vacation on the coast of Jersey, I was not coming.
I was going through my summers in a war zone, because my parents were afraid if we don't go back to Palestine all the <unk> we were going to become <unk>
In the summer summer later, I often tried to <unk> so I was drinking milk from <unk> so I would drink <unk> milk on the back, <unk> me in the <unk> Sea, and I remember the water <unk> my eyes and I was like, <unk> <unk>
But the <unk> cure was yoga.
I must say that it's very boring, but before we do yoga was a <unk> comedian that I couldn't stand up with <unk> <unk>
And now I can put it in your head.
My parents would answer this idea that I could do anything, that no dream was impossible, and my dream was to be at the <unk> Hospital <unk>
I went to college through positive discrimination and I got a grant for the University of Arizona, because I was in all the <unk>
It was like <unk> the pet <unk>
All of me <unk>
I did all the tasks of the least of the <unk> I took the top note in my teaching and also in his classes.
Every time I was doing a scene from the <unk> of glass my teachers <unk>
But I never got a piece of paper.
Finally, in my last year, the <unk> decided to make a work called very slow <unk> in Jackson.
It's a piece of a girl with cerebral <unk>
I was a girl with cerebral <unk>
So I started screaming at the four <unk> The end will have a <unk>
I have paralysis <unk>
<unk> finally <unk>
Thank God <unk> I'm a <unk>
I didn't get the paper.  They gave him to <unk> Brown.
I went to <unk> running to the director of the theater, crying historically, as if someone had killed my cat, ask him why and she told me that because they believed that I could not make the stunt scenes.
And I said, <unk> if I can't do the risk, you can't do the <unk>
It was a paper that was literally born and gave it to a actress without a cerebral <unk>
College was imitating my life.
Hollywood has a <unk> story of <unk> actors as disability for disabled paper.
And I went back home, and I went home, and my first tour <unk> was as extra in a <unk>
My dream became true.
And I knew it would be <unk> from <unk> to <unk> friend <unk> in a <unk>
And instead, I stayed there as a <unk> I didn't see it more than the <unk> and it was obvious to me that directors are not <unk> actors, actors, with disability.
Just give up to perfect people.
But there was exceptions to the rule.
I grew up watching <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and all these women had one thing in common: they were <unk>
So I made it <unk>
In my first tour, I took a famous comic book from New Jersey in New Jersey, and I will never forget the face of the first note that he took when he fell in the account that I was going to go high speed on the New Jersey highway with a driver that had cerebral <unk>
I worked in clubs across the United States, and also in Arabic in the Middle East, without censorship and <unk>
Some people say I'm the first <unk> of the Arab world.
I never like to reclaim the first place, but I know they never heard that little ugly rumor that women are not fun, and they find quite fun.
In 2003, my brother of another mother and father, Dean <unk> and I launched the Festival of the <unk> <unk> of New York, now in his 10.
Our goal was to change the negative image of the <unk> in media and then to remind the CEOs that <unk> and Arabic is not <unk>
<unk> were much easier to fight the challenge of stigma for disability.
My great opportunity was in 2010.
I went as invited to the <unk> news program, by cable <unk>
I went into a graduate dance dance to a study and they sat down in a wheelchair.
I looked at the director and I said, <unk> can give me another <unk>
She looked at me and said, <unk> four, three, <unk>
And we were in <unk>
So I kept at the desk desk that I didn't go out of the screen during the <unk> and when I finished the interview, I was <unk>
I was finally able to have my opportunity and <unk> I knew I wouldn't get me.
But not only Mr. <unk> went back to <unk> but I was going to have a full time and hit my chair.
Something fun that I learned in direct with Keith <unk> was that people on the Internet are <unk>
It tells you that kids are <unk> but they never become <unk> of me or a little girl.
Suddenly, my disability on the Internet became <unk>
I would hear music clips like, "Why do you <unk>
"It's <unk>
And my favorite one, <unk> <unk>
What disease does it?
We should really pray for it.
A <unk> suggested even that I would add my disability to my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> is as visual as race.
If someone in a wheelchair can't do <unk> then <unk> you can't get someone in a wheelchair.
<unk> are the <unk> Yeah, <unk> man.
<unk> are the largest minority of the world, and the most <unk> in the world of entertainment.
Doctors said not to be <unk> but I'm here in front of you.
However, I have grown up with the media, I don't think they <unk>
I hope together we can create more positive images of disability in media and everyday life.
Maybe if there were more positive images, that will be less <unk> on the Internet.
Or maybe no.
Maybe we still need the whole society to teach our children.
My journey has led me to very spectacular places.
I came to <unk> by the red carpet <unk> by the <unk> Susan <unk> and the famous <unk> <unk>
I came to act in a movie with Adam <unk> and working with my <unk> the incredible Dave <unk>
<unk> the <unk> world have become <unk>
I was <unk> in the New Jersey state of New Jersey in the <unk> of 2008.
And I founded <unk> children of <unk> a charity to give for refugee children in a very narrow part of what my parents would tell me.
It was the only time my father saw me act live, and I do this talk to your memory.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
I call myself <unk> <unk> and if I can, you can too.
I'd like to tell you a story about a kid in a young town.
I don't know her name, but I know your story.
She lives in a small town in the South <unk>
This village is about <unk>
<unk> drives small people to poverty and on the edge of the <unk>
Without anything for him there, it goes to the big city, in this case, <unk> the capital of Somalia.
When it comes there, there is no opportunities, there's no work, no perspectives of the future.
He's just living in a tent in the city outside of <unk>
After maybe a year <unk> nothing.
One day I read about a guy who offered him to <unk> after him after dinner, <unk>
He meets a dynamic group of people, which gives you a break.
She gets a little bit of money to buy new clothes, money to send home, her family.
They present to a young boy.
He finally went home.
It starts a new life.
It has a goal of life.
A very beautiful day in <unk> under a blue sky bursts a bomb.
That kid in that small town with the dreams of the great city was the <unk> bomber and that dynamic group of people were the <unk> a terrorist organization with the Qaeda.
So, how did the story of a small village trying to fulfill their dreams in the city ends with him <unk>
He was waiting.
I was expecting an opportunity, hoping to start his future, waiting for a future perspective, and this was the first thing that arrived.
This was the first thing that took him out of what we call "the period of <unk>
And their story is repeated in urban centers around the world.
It's the story of the <unk> young people who were <unk> riots in <unk> <unk> riots in London, who are looking for something beyond the <unk> of <unk>
For young people, the promise of the city, the great dream of the city is the opportunity for the opportunity, but young people don't participate in the prosperity of their cities.
It's often the youth who suffers from the highest <unk>
By 2030, three of five people living in cities will be under 18 years.
If we don't include young people in the growth of our cities, if they don't give them opportunities -- the story of the <unk> the door of access to terror, violence to <unk> will be the story of developing cities.
And in my city of birth, <unk> 70 percent of the young people are <unk>
70 percent don't work, it's not going to school.
They do virtually nothing.
I went back to <unk> last month, and I went to visit the <unk> Hospital.
I remember being at that hospital <unk> to <unk> thinking, and if I never had gone?
And if I'd seen me forced to be in that same <unk> <unk>
I would have become <unk>
I'm not really sure the answer.
The reason I was in <unk> that month was actually to support a juvenile leaders at a business enterprise.
<unk> about 90 juvenile leaders, <unk>
We sat and we had a rain of ideas about solutions to the big challenges facing the city.
One of the young people in the room was <unk>
He went to the University of <unk> <unk>
There was no work, no opportunity.
I remember when he said to me, because I was a graduate student, <unk> frustrated, was the perfect white for <unk> and other organizations in terrorists, to be <unk>
They were looking for people like it.
But this story takes a different path.
In <unk> the biggest obstacle to get from point A to the B is the streets.
<unk> years of civil war have destroyed the traffic system, and a motorcycle can be the easiest way to <unk>
<unk> saw an opportunity and <unk>
He started a <unk> company.
He started <unk> silence to local residents who normally couldn't afford it.
I bought 10 <unk> with the help of her family and friends, and his dream is at some point to grow hundreds of motorcycles over the next three years.
So why is this story?
What does this story different?
I think their ability to identify and leverage a new opportunity.
It's the corporate spirit and I think the business spirit can be the most powerful tool against <unk> <unk>
They will lead to young people to be the creators of the economic opportunities that are looking so strong.
And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs.
I want to talk to you about a young man who attended one of my meetings, Mohamed <unk> a <unk>
I was <unk> to train some of the young people at the pinnacle of business <unk> and how to be innovative and how to create a culture of business.
In fact, it's the first <unk> that <unk> has seen in over 22 years, and until Mohamed arrived, if you wanted flowers for your <unk> <unk> we were from plastic down from the overseas.
If you ask someone, "When was the last time you saw <unk>
For those of you who grew up during the civil war, the answer is: <unk>
So Mohamed saw an opportunity.
He started a company of <unk> and <unk>
I created a farm on the outskirts of <unk> and began to grow <unk> and <unk> that according to it, they could survive the hard weather of <unk>
And it started the delivery of flowers for weddings and creating gardens in the houses, and the city companies and now is working on the creation of the first public park <unk> in 22 years.
There are no public parks.
He wants to create a space where families -- young people, can go together, and, as he says, sniff <unk> <unk>
He's not growing up and he's not growing a lot of water.
So, the first step is to inspire the young people, and in that room, the presence of Mohamed had a really profound impact on young people.
They had never thought about starting a business.
They had thought about working for an NGO, working for the government, but their history, innovation, it really had a strong impact on them.
It forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity.
I encouraged them to believe that they could be entrepreneurs, that could be <unk> of change.
For the end of the day, they had innovative solutions for some of the greatest challenges facing the city.
<unk> business solutions for local problems.
So, let's inspire young people and create a culture of corporate spirit -- is actually a big step, but the young people need a capital to do their reality.
They need experience and orientation for <unk> in development and put in their business.
They would lead to young people with the resources that they need, <unk> the support they need to move from understanding to creation, and create a <unk> for urban growth.
For me, the business spirit is something more to start a business.
It's to create a social impact.
Mohamed isn't simply selling flowers.
I think it's selling hope.
His <unk> <unk> is how it calls it when it is created, to transform the way that people see their city.
<unk> hired children from the street to help rent and keep the motorcycles for him.
He gave them the opportunity to escape <unk> <unk> of <unk>
These young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact on their cities.
So my suggestion is, they will become young people in entrepreneurs, <unk> and eating their innovation <unk> and they will have more stories about flowers and Parks and <unk> and <unk> of <unk>
Thank you.
I was about 10 years old, and I went to <unk> with my dad in the <unk> <unk> a <unk> area north of the state of New York.
It was a beautiful day.
The forest <unk>
The sun was making the leaves <unk> like a <unk> and not to be the way that we had to be able to pretend that we were the first human beings to step on that ground.
We got to our camp.
It was a shed in a <unk> with a beautiful <unk> lake.
Behind the shed was a <unk> of about four square feet with apple hearts -- <unk> paper balls <unk> and old <unk>
And I was <unk> I was very mad and incredibly <unk>
The <unk> who were too lazy to get what they thought they were going to clean up their <unk>
That question followed with me, and you get a little bit of a little bit.
Who clean our <unk>
No matter how they <unk> or where <unk> <unk> who clean our garbage in <unk>
Who clean our garbage in Rio or in Paris or in <unk>
Here in New York City, the <unk> Department of <unk> the <unk> of 11 tons of waste and two tons of <unk> products every day.
I wanted to meet you as individuals.
I wanted to understand who does that work.
What does the uniform feel like to use the uniform and take that <unk>
So I started a research project with them.
I traveled on the trucks and I walked through her routes and I interviewed people in offices and facilities in all the city, and I learned a lot, but it was still a <unk>
I needed a little bit more.
So I started working as a trash.
Now I didn't just travel in the trucks. I was <unk>
And operated the mechanical and mechanics and the snow.
It was a remarkable privilege and an amazing learning.
They all ask about the smell.
It's there, but it's not as ubiquitous as you believe it, and in the days that it's very strong you would get very hard to get into it.
It costs a lot to get out of weight.
I met people who had worked on it for several years, and their bodies were still <unk> the weight of taking on their body tons of garbage all the weeks.
It's also the danger.
According to the Bureau of <unk> <unk> the collection of waste is one of the most dangerous <unk> of the country, and I learned the reason.
You're coming out and entering the traffic all day and pass around around you.
They just want to <unk> so often the driver is not paying attention.
That's very bad for the <unk>
And the garbage itself is full of dangers that often fall out of the truck and cause terrible damage.
I also learned about how relentless the trash.
When you get out of the <unk> and you see a city from the back of the truck, you get to understand that garbage is like a force of nature itself.
He never stopped coming.
It's also like a way of breathing or circulation.
It's always going to be movement.
And it's also the stigma.
I think the stigma is especially ironic because I think that the <unk> of waste is the most important work of work in the streets of the city, for three reasons.
They are the first <unk> of public health.
If you don't get rid of the waste of the efficient and effective form every day -- this starts to <unk> from their container and their dangers inherent in very real ways.
Whether we had controlled for decades and centuries come up and start <unk>
The economy needs it.
If we can't get rid of the old we don't have space for what the engines of economics start to fail when it's in danger of the <unk>
I'm not advocating for capitalism, just to point his relationship.
And then it's what I call our average speed we need.
I mean, I mean just the speed of the using the <unk> to move into contemporary time.
Usually we don't get rid of it, we don't have to get it off, or we carry our cup of coffee, our bag of the <unk> our water bottle.
We use the <unk> we forget about them, because we know that there is a job force on the other side that will take for it.
So today I want to suggest to you today a couple of ways to think about the collection of waste that maybe help reduce the stigma and engage in that conversation about how to design a sustainable and human city.
Her job, I think, is almost <unk>
They're on the street every day, <unk>
They use a uniform in many cities.
Do you know when <unk>
And their work allows us to do our work.
It's almost a way of relief.
The flow that keeps us apart from ourselves, from our own <unk> our <unk> and that flow is always to stay in one form or another.
One day after September 11, 2001, I heard the <unk> of a waste collection of waste on the street, grabbed my son and went down the stairs running on the stairs and there was a man doing his journey of paper like I did all the <unk>
And I tried to thank for his job that particular day, but I began to cry.
And I looked at me and just <unk> and said, "We're going to be fine.
We're going to be right."
Shortly after that, I started looking at the collection collection and I went back to see that man.
It's called <unk> we work together many times and we got good friends.
I want to believe that <unk> was right.
We're going to be fine.
But in our efforts by <unk> the way we exist on this planet as a species we have to include and have to account every costs -- even the very real human cost of labor.
<unk> waste is what we think when we talk about garbage represent three percent of the <unk>
It's a remarkable statistic here.
So in the flow of your days and their lives, the next thing to see someone whose work is to clean up the garbage of you, <unk> a moment to <unk>
<unk> a moment to tell you thank you.
My work focuses on thinking about our communal lives, becoming part of the environment where architecture is born naturally from conditions and local traditions.
So I brought two recent projects as an example of this.
Both projects are located in the emerging countries, one in Ethiopia and the other in Tunisia.
They also share the fact that different analysis from different perspectives become an essential part of the end of architecture.
The first example started with an invitation to design a commercial center of a number of floors in the capital.
This is the kind of building that showed us as an example of my team and me, about what we had to design.
At first, the first thing I thought was, "I want to get <unk>
After seeing some of these buildings there are many in the city we realized that there are three important aspects to <unk>
In principle, these buildings are almost empty because they have very large stores where people can't afford to buy things.
Second, it takes a lot to use a lot of energy because the coating of the <unk> generates heat into the interior, so it takes a lot of <unk>
In a city where this should not happen because it's a temperate weather that goes from 20 to 25 degrees during the entire year.
And thirdly, what does it look like to do with Africa and with Ethiopia.
It's a <unk> for a very rich place in culture and traditions.
In our first visit to Ethiopia, was really enchanted with the old market that is this structure to the open air where thousands of people, go and buy things every day to little <unk>
There is also that idea of using public space to generate external activity.
So I thought, that's what I really wanted to design, not a commercial center.
But the question was how to build a modern modern modern modern technology, applying these principles.
The next challenge was presented to the site, the website, which is located in a very large area of the city, where much of the buildings that we now see in the picture, not exist yet.
And it's also between two different streets that don't communicate in a range of hundreds of feet.
So the first thing we did was to create a connection between these two streets -- <unk> all the entries in the building.
And this goes through a <unk> <unk> that creates a space to the open air in the building that would be held by its own shape, in the sun and the rain.
And around this space we've applied the idea of the market with small businesses, which changes on every floor because of the form of space.
I also thought, how to close the building?
I wanted to find a solution that would lead to the local climate conditions.
And I started thinking about a fabric like a concrete shell, with <unk> to allow the air input and also the light, but in a <unk> way.
Then we were inspired by these beautiful buttons.
They have properties of fractal geometry and this helped me to model the <unk>
We're building that with these little <unk> pieces that are the windows that leave the air and light in a controlled way inside of the building.
This is going to be attached to these little colors of colors that use the light from the inside of the building to illuminate the building at night.
And with these ideas it didn't be easy to convince developers because they thought, "That's not a commercial mall, it wasn't what we <unk>
But ultimately we realized that this idea of the market was much more profitable than the mall because in order to end up there were more local to sell.
And the idea of the facade was much more economic, not just because of the material compared to the glass, but also because it wasn't necessary to have air conditioning.
So we get certain savings in the budget that we use to implement the project.
The first thing was to think about how to make the building power for the building in a city where the electricity is cut almost every day.
So we got a great advantage by putting <unk> on the roof.
And then under those panels we think of the roof as a new public space with areas of meeting and bars that would create this <unk>
And these <unk> on the roof that we have to collect water for <unk>
It's waiting for the beginning of the next year, because we go through the fifth floor of construction.
The second example is a master plan of 2,000 apartments and services in the city of Tunisia.
And to make a project so big, the biggest thing that I've been doing, I needed not just understanding the city of Tunisia, but also to its environment, its tradition and culture.
During that analysis, I put special attention in the <unk> a <unk> structure that was surrounded by a wall with twelve doors of access connected by straight lines.
When I went to the place, the first design operation that we did was extend the streets in the streets -- creating 12 initial blocks in size and features that there are in Barcelona and other cities of Europe with these <unk>
In addition to that, we choose some strategic dots in relation to the idea of the doors of doors with straight lines, and this altered the initial model.
And the last operation was to think about the cell, the small cell in the project, like the apartment, as an essential part of the master plan.
I thought, what's the best orientation for an apartment in the climate <unk>
And it's <unk> because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house and therefore natural ventilation.
So they would take a scheme that makes sure that most of the apartments are perfectly <unk> in that direction.
And this is the result that it's almost like a combination of the European block and the Arab city.
It has these blocks with <unk> and then in the lower plant we have all the connections to <unk>
And it also responds to local norms that they set up a higher density in higher levels and lower density in the ground floor.
And it also reinforces this idea of the doors.
The roof, which is my favorite space of the project is almost like giving the community to the space that was occupied by construction.
It's where all the neighbors, can go up and <unk> and doing activities like running a <unk> race in the morning or jump from one building to another building.
These two examples, have a common approach to the design process.
And also, they're in emerging countries, where you can see the cities that are literally growing.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in the lives of people change the communities and local economies at the same rate as the buildings.
For this reason, I see even more important to look at architecture looking for simple solutions, but <unk> that improve the relationship between the community and the environment and they have as a goal to connect nature to the people.
Thank you very much.
When I was eight years old, a little girl joined our class. It was as remarkable, as you see all the new girls.
He had huge amounts of very bright hair, and a little little bit of predatory pencils was super strong to the capitals of states, very good for <unk>
I ended up that year and I was full of starch, until I get my sinister sinister plan.
One day I stayed at a time after the way out of school, I was a little late and I hid in the bathroom of the girls.
When the coast was <unk> salt, I went into the classroom, I took off the table of my master's book.
And then I did.
I'm going to see the ratings of my <unk> just a little bit of those.
All the same.  And I set up to return the book to the <unk> but to see, some of my other colleagues had very good notes as well.
So in a <unk> <unk> the notes of all over the world, without any imagination.
I put all of rows of <unk> and myself a row out of it, just because of being there, because they were <unk>
I'm still surprised what I did.
I don't understand how the idea came from.
I don't understand why I was doing it right.
I felt important.
I don't understand why I never get <unk>
It's that everything was <unk> obvious to it.
I would never be surprised.
But most of all, I was telling myself the reason that I thought that this little little little little girl, was so good for <unk>
Would jealousy.
They are so <unk> and so <unk>
We know that babies suffer from jealousy.
But the primates. <unk> are very <unk>
We know that <unk> are the number one cause of acting in the U.S.
And yet, I've never seen a study that <unk> the loneliness, or the long duration or sadness.
So you have to go to fiction, because novels are like the lab where the <unk> are studying in all their possible shapes.
In fact, I don't know if it is exaggeration to say that if there was no rain, to say it would have no literature.
Well, there would be no <unk> the <unk> wouldn't have <unk>
No king would have <unk> or <unk> and <unk>
No Shakespeare.
<unk> the reading lists of high school -- because we would be losing "The <unk> and the <unk> wouldn't have <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
There is no <unk> I know it's fashionable to say that <unk> has the answers for everything, and as soon as it has all of them.
This year is spent 100 years of his work <unk> "In search for time -- the most <unk> study of sexual <unk> and also the ordinary <unk> -- my God, all that we might have.  And thinking about <unk> we have the details of <unk> right?
We think in a child trying to reconcile the dream.
We think in a <unk> <unk> in <unk>
We forgot about how hard this image.
We forgot how relentless it is.
I mean, this is books that Virginia <unk> said they were as tough as <unk>
I don't know how a cat, but we assume it's <unk>
Let's see why they go so well together, the novel and the <unk> the <unk> and <unk>
It's going to be very obvious as the resemblance to be reduced to the person, to their desire, to their <unk> are a good narrative base.
I don't know. I think we get very close to the bone, when we think about what happens when we feel jealousy.
When we feel hard, we tell ourselves a story.
One story about other people, and those stories make us feel terrible because they're designed for that, to make us feel wrong.
As long as storytellers and audience, we know exactly what kind of details to <unk> the knife -- right?
The <unk> make us all novelists <unk> and that's something that I was able to understand.
All that she does to give me pleasure could give pleasure to another, maybe right now."
And it starts to say itself that story, and since then, <unk> says that every charm <unk> that <unk> detects in his lover it adds up to his collection of instruments of torture in your private camera.
You have to admit that <unk> and <unk> were notoriously <unk>
You know, <unk> <unk> would have to abandon the country, if they wanted to break up with it.
But you don't have to be so <unk> to recognize that it's hard work. Right?
<unk> are <unk>
It's an <unk> <unk>
And how are the <unk>
<unk> are <unk> from information.
<unk> use the details.
<unk> they like the big amounts of bright hair, and the cute little <unk> <unk>
The <unk> came up with the photos.
That's why Instagram is so successful --  <unk> links good language <unk> with jealousy.
When <unk> is in his agony of constantly listening to the doors and <unk> to the <unk> of his lover -- then it provoked those behaviors.
He says, "Look, I know you think this is <unk> but it's not different from the interpretation of an old text or looking at a <unk>
He says, "Oh, it's a scientific research with real value.
<unk> is trying to prove that <unk> you see <unk> and they make it seem to be <unk> but in their <unk> they're search for knowledge, search of truth, really a painful truth, in fact, to what <unk> <unk> the more I mean the better the better.
The pain, the <unk> <unk> -- these were the pathways to the wisdom of <unk>
He says, "A woman who we need to, that makes us suffer, it causes us a range of feelings that are much more profound and vital than a wise man who can tell us.
It's telling us that we're going to look for women.
No. I think it's trying to say that <unk> reveal ourselves.
And there's some other emotion that makes us <unk> in this particular <unk>
Is there any other excitement to us, our <unk> our horrible ambition and our <unk>
Any other emotion that teaches us to look at very <unk>
Freud would write about this later.
One day, Freud was visited by a very young young young man who was consumed with the idea that her woman would kill him.
And Freud said there was something weird in that man, which was not <unk> in what his wife.
Well, she was <unk> everybody knew it.
The poor creature was under suspicion without any cause.
But he was looking for things that he did his wife, without realizing it.
<unk> <unk> or do it accidentally accidentally <unk> with a man?
Freud said that man was becoming the <unk> of the unconscious wife.
<unk> are really good at this.
The novels described very well how the <unk> are going to look at the intensity but <unk>
In fact, the more intensely <unk> the more we are, we are more than fantasy.
And for this reason, I think, <unk> lead us to make violent or illegal.
<unk> drive us to behave in a totally <unk> way.
Now I'm thinking about myself at eight years old, <unk> but I'm also thinking about this story that I heard in the news.
A woman of Michigan from 52 years old, was captured by having created a false account on Facebook from which they were sent by a little bit horrible <unk> for a year.
For a year, every year.
She was trying to convince the new girlfriend of her former boyfriend, I have to confess that when or this, I reacted to <unk>
Because let's be realistic.
How big -- even though you get creativity. Right?
It's like <unk>
Like a <unk> Patricia <unk>
<unk> is one of my favorites.
She's a very strange and brilliant character of American literature.
It's the author of <unk> in a <unk> and "The <unk> Mr. <unk> who are trying to deal with our minds, and once we are in the sphere, in the realm of jealousy, the membrane that separates what it might be, can be <unk> in a second.
Take Tom <unk> his most famous character.
So Tom <unk> is going to be <unk> or want what you have to do is you have to get the <unk> of being and <unk> from what you ever want, and it's under the floor -- it takes your rings, it takes your cow rings, your bank accounts.
It's a way.
But what do we do? We can't take the route of Tom <unk>
I can't give you all the world, as much as I wanted to.
It's a pity, because we live in times of envy.
We live in times jealousy.
I mean, we're good citizens of social media, where the currency is <unk> right?
The novels show us <unk> I'm not sure.
So we're going to do what the characters always do when they're not safe when they're in front of a mystery.
Let's go to the <unk> Street and ask for <unk> <unk>
When people think about <unk> think about <unk> <unk> in Professor <unk> that criminal genius.
But I've always been <unk> <unk> <unk> the head of <unk> rat <unk> which needs <unk> <unk> needs the <unk> genius, but it bothers him.
Oh, I sounds so <unk>
<unk> needs their help, but it <unk> and <unk> it with <unk> in each of those puzzles.
But as they work together, something starts to change, and finally in "The <unk> of <unk> <unk> once <unk> <unk> <unk> to all of his solution, <unk> goes back to <unk> and says, "We're not <unk> Mr. <unk>
We're proud of <unk>
And he tells him that there's no person in <unk> <unk> that I wouldn't want to <unk> your hand.
It's one of the very few times that we see <unk> moved in history. It seems to me very emotional -- that scene is also mysterious, right?
It seems to treat <unk> as a problem of geometry, without emotion.
You know, in a minute <unk> it's the opposite side of <unk>
So the next minute you're on the same side.
Suddenly, they would be able to admire that idea of being the <unk>
It could still be so simple?
What if the <unk> are actually a matter of geometry, just a question of where we allow us to be in relation to this?
Well, maybe we don't have to take away from the excellence of the other.
We can do it with it.
But I like the <unk> plans.
So as we hope that happens, we remember that we have the fiction fiction.
Just the fiction fiction, jealousy.
The fiction used to <unk> invites them to the table.
And look at what <unk> the sweet <unk> the terrifying <unk> Tom <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We're in great company.
Thank you.
We used to solve big problems.
On July 21, 1969, Buzz Aldrin jumped out of the <unk> <unk> of Apollo 11 and landed on the Sea of the <unk>
Armstrong and Aldrin were alone, but his presence on the surface of the surface of the surface was the culmination of a collective collective process.
The Apollo program was the largest mobilization.
To get to the moon, NASA spent about 180 billion dollars from today, or four percent of the federal budget.
Apollo gave work to about 400,000 people and asked the collaboration of 20,000 businesses, universities and government agencies.
They died people, including <unk> <unk>
But before the Apollo program <unk> 24 men went to the moon.
<unk> walked on top of his surface, which addresses after Armstrong of Armstrong last year, is now the most <unk>
So why do you <unk>
They didn't get a lot of <unk> <unk> kilos of old rocks, and something that was 24 percent later, a new sense of <unk> and the fragility of our common home.
Why <unk> The cynical answer is that they were because President Kennedy wanted to demonstrate to the <unk> that this nation had better rockets.
But the words of Kennedy at the University of Rice in <unk> give us a better idea.
John F. <unk> Some ask why the <unk>
Why turn it into our goal?
And they might ask, why will the mountain scale down.
35 years ago, why do you fly on the <unk>
Why do you play Rice against <unk>
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon in this decade, and doing other things, not because they're simple, but because they're hard.
Jason <unk> For the <unk> the Apollo was not just a victory of the West on the Cold War.
At the time, the stronger emotion was the <unk> to the notion of the powers of technology.
They were because it was something great to be able to do it.
The landing on the moon happened in a context of a long list of technology.
The first half of the 20th century produced the assembly line and the plane, penicillin and the vaccine for tuberculosis.
In the middle of the century, it was <unk> and it was eliminated by smallpox.
The technology seemed to own what Alvin <unk> in 1970, called <unk> <unk>
For most of the history of humanity, we couldn't go faster than a horse, or a boat with candle -- but in 1969, the <unk> crew of Apollo 10 flew to 40,000 miles / hour.
Since 1970, no human being turned to the moon.
No one has traveled the crew of Apollo 10, and the joyful <unk> about the power of Apollo 10, and the joyful <unk> about the power of technology has been <unk> to go to Mars, create a clean energy, cure cancer, or feeding the world population seem to be <unk>
I remember watching Apollo 17.
I was five years old, and my mother told me that I didn't go to the <unk> tube <unk> from the rocket Saturn <unk>
I knew that this would be the last <unk> mission, but I was completely sure that I could see the colonies on Mars.
So that stuff happened to our ability to solve problems with <unk> has become a common place.
We heard it all the time.
We've heard this for the last two days here, at TED.
It seems like the technologists would have <unk> us and have enriched with trivial toys, things like <unk> applications and social networks, or social media, or algorithms that speed up the selling sell.
There's nothing wrong with most of these things.
They have expanded and enriched our lives.
But we don't have the great problems of humanity.
What happened?
There is an arbitrary explanation in Silicon Valley, that <unk> that have been created less ambitious companies that are <unk> in the years that we're going to be <unk> Intel and Apple and <unk>
Silicon Valley says that markets are the guilty, and concrete, the incentives that venture capitalists are offered for entrepreneurs.
Silicon Valley says that the risk of risk caused the creation of <unk> ideas by funding by <unk> or even false problems.
But I don't think this explanation is good enough.
<unk> mostly what's going wrong in <unk> Valley.
Even when the venture capitalists were at the peak of the risk without worrying about the risk, they preferred small investments, investment than they could go out in 10 years.
<unk> have always had problems to invest with the benefit of technologies like energy, which need a huge capital and whose development is long-term capital, not have invested in the development of technologies that are intended to solve big problems because they don't have an immediate commercial value.
No, the reasons why we can't solve the big problems are more complicated and profound.
Sometimes we choose to do not solve big problems.
Could we go to Mars if you are."
NASA has even designed a plan.
But going to Mars would require a political decision that was popular and that will never happen.
We're not going to go to Mars because everyone thinks there are more important things to do on Earth.
Sometimes, we can't solve big problems because political systems fail.
Today, less than two percent of the global energy consumption comes from energy sources like solar and wind and <unk> Less than two percent, and the reason is completely cheap.
Water and natural gas are cheaper than solar and wind, and oil is cheaper than the <unk>
We want to be sources of alternatives that can compete at the price.
Now, technologists, entrepreneurs and entrepreneurs and economists agree on what political policies and international treaties -- the development of a <unk> energy <unk> a significant increase in research and development development, and some kind of control of the price of coal.
But there is no hope in the current political climate that we will see an energy policy that we will see in America or international treaties that reflect that consensus.
Sometimes, the big problems that looked like technological, it turns out not to be.
We know from time that famines are a result of failure on the route, of food.
But 30 years of research have taught us that famines are the policies that affect <unk> the distribution of food.
Technology can be able to improve things like harvest or systems for storage to storage and flow of food, but there will be famines while there was bad governments.
Finally, big problems sometimes <unk> a solution because we don't understand the problem really.
The president Nixon declared the war war in 1971, but we soon found that there are many types of cancer, some terribly resistant guys to treatment, and only in the last 10 years, they seem to have found safe treatments and viable.
The hard problems are hard.
It's not true that we can't solve problems with technology.
We can and we need -- but these four elements have been <unk> the political leaders and the population must want to address the problem, the institutions must be supported by the problem, the institutions must be really a <unk> problem, and we have to understand it.
The <unk> mission that has become something like a metaphor for the ability of technology to solve big problems with those <unk>
But it's a <unk> model in the future.
We're not in <unk>
There is no <unk> competition like in the Cold War, there is no politician like John Kennedy who <unk> the hard and the dangerous thing, and there's not a popular mythology of science fiction as the <unk>
In general, go to the moon turned out to be simple.
I was just three days.
And really, I was not even <unk> no problem.
We're alone in our present, and the solutions of the future will be harder to get.
God knows that we don't have the challenges.
Thank you very much.
Well, I'm going to talk about trust, and I'm going to start <unk> the <unk> ideas that have about trust.
They are so common that they've become <unk> of our society.
I think it's three.
The first one is a <unk> there's been a great decrease of trust, is a very general math.
The second is a goal: we should have more trust.
And the third is a <unk> we should recover the trust.
I think that <unk> the goal and the task has been <unk>
What I'm going to try to tell you about today is a different story about a <unk> a target and a task, which I think gives a more clear idea about the subject.
First, why do people think that trust has <unk>
And if I think about the basis of my own <unk> I don't know the answer.
It makes me bow to think that there may be reduced in some activities or institutions and that might have risen on others.
I have no clear.
But I can turn to research polls and opinion polls are supposed to be the source of belief that trust has decreased.
When you look at the opinion polls over time, there aren't many evidence of it.
I mean, the people who are <unk> 20 years ago, mostly journalists and politicians, keep <unk> the same <unk>
And the people who were very reliable about 20 years ago, they are still quite <unk> by nurses.
The rest of us are in the middle, and by the way, the average citizen of the street is almost exactly half the way.
But it's evidence enough?
What the opinion polls are, of course, opinions.
What else can you get?
What you see is the attitudes that people see is the <unk> people when they do some questions.
<unk> in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
Now, if someone asked you, <unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in the <unk> teachers.
It's probably <unk> by asking, "What do you do?"
And that would be a very strong answer.
And you could say, when you answered your question, "Well, I trust some, but in other not."
What's very rational.
Ultimately, in real life, we tend to trust the confidence <unk>
We don't assume that the level of trust that we're going to feel for a certain kind of official, official or type of person, is going to be the uniform in all cases.
I could, for example, say I trust a certain elementary teacher I know to give the science class, but no way to drive the school <unk>
After all, I could know that it wasn't a good <unk>
I could trust my friend more <unk> to keep a conversation, but no, maybe to keep a secret.
Simple.
And if we've got those evidence in our everyday lives in the way that trust is <unk> why we let on all that knowledge when we think about trust in a more <unk> way.
So I think these surveys are very bad tools to measure the real level of real trust, because they are trying to make a good judgment of inherent to trust something or somebody.
Second, what about the goal?
The goal is to have more trust.
Frankly, I think it's a stupid.
It's not that the goal that I was <unk>
I will encourage you to have more confidence in what is <unk> but not what it is.
Ultimately, I'm a <unk> of not trust what is not reliable.
And I think that those people who would spend their savings with the very <unk> called Mr. <unk> who then disappeared with them, I think, well, yeah, they were too <unk>
Having more trust is not a smart goal in this life.
<unk> deposited or <unk> with intelligence, that's the right goal.
Once you say, it says, yeah, OK, that means that what matters first is not the trust, but trustworthiness.
What it's trying to do is do a judgment of how reliable people are in certain ways.
And I think to be able to do a trial, we're forced to focus on three things.
They're <unk> They're <unk> They're <unk>
And if we find that one person is <unk> in the <unk> and it's responsible and honest, then we'll have a very good reason to trust it, because it's going to be a <unk>
But if, on the contrary, they're not <unk> we couldn't trust them.
I have friends who are <unk> and honest, but they didn't take a letter to the mail, because they are <unk>
I have friends who are very sure that they can do certain things, but I see that I see their own <unk>
And I'm very happy to say that I think I don't have a lot of friends that are <unk> and responsible for but extremely <unk>
If it's like this, I still have no <unk>
But that's what we're looking at about before we trust.
<unk> is the answer.
<unk> is what we need to do.
And of course, it's hard.
In the last few decades, we tried to build accountability systems for all kinds of institutions, professionals, officials and others, who made us easier to judge their trustworthiness.
Many of those systems have had the opposite effect.
They don't work like <unk>
I remember one time I was talking to a <unk> and he said, "Well, you'll see the problem is that it takes more time to make the <unk> <unk> that will go into <unk>
And we found the same problem in all of our public life, and we need to argue that the accountability system is destined to ensure the <unk> and the testing of <unk> actually is making the opposite.
What they do is <unk> the work of people who have to do hard tasks, like the <unk> <unk> that we <unk> the <unk> as we say.
You've got all of you know similar examples.
<unk> all of that, for the target.
I think the goal should be more <unk> and that things would be a lot of being worthy if it will be worthy of trust and encourage people to be worthy of the people that are safe and if you try to determine whether other people or political officials are worthy of trust.
It's not easy. It's the judgment, the simple, <unk> <unk> which is not done properly.
Third, the task.
<unk> the task to rebuild the trust, puts things backwards.
It suggests that you and I should actually rebuild the trust.
Well, we can do it with ourselves.
We can reconstruct a little bit about trustworthiness.
We can do it if they're two people, trying to improve trust.
But trust, ultimately is essential because we give them other people.
You can't reconstruct what other people have given you.
You have to give them the foundations enough to be able to trust you.
You have to be worthy of trust.
And that, of course, is because you can't do it for all of the people all the time.
But you also have to be able to be able to be able to give you a sense of evidence that you're worthy of trust.
How do you do that?
That makes every day, everywhere, it makes you all the common people, the <unk> the institutions, very well.
Let me give you a simple commercial example.
The store where I buy my socks says I can <unk> it without a explanations.
I take them and get the money, or they change it for the color I want.
That's great. I trust them because they became vulnerable to me.
I think there's a big lesson in that.
If you become more vulnerable to the other hand, that's a very good proof that you're worthy of trust and you have confidence in what you're saying.
So in the end, I think what we're pointing is not a very difficult thing to <unk>
What people rely on is relationships, and in that framework, you can determine when and how the other person is <unk>
Thank you.
From the beginning of computers we've been <unk> by reducing the separation between us and the digital information, the separation between our material and the world of the screen in which the imagination can be <unk>
This separation has gone and more and more and more and more and more than today is less than one millimeter, the thickness of a <unk> <unk> and the power of computing has become accessible to all.
But I ask myself, if there was no <unk>
I started imagining how to <unk>
First of all, I created this tool that goes deeper into the digital space, so that when it was very strong against the screen it transfers your physical body to the West.
Designers can take their ideas directly into 3D, and surgeons can practice with virtual organs under the screen.
So with this tool, they break down.
But the two hands remain out of the screen.
How do you get inside and interact with digital information using the whole skill of your hands?
In the <unk> division of Microsoft, from Microsoft, along with my mentor <unk> <unk> the computer and transformed a little space on the keyboard in a digital area of work.
<unk> an transparent bombsight with deep cameras to detect the fingers and the face, you can now raise the hands of the keyboard, get inside of the 3D space, and grab pixels directly with your hands.
Like windows and files have a location in real space, it's as easy as grab a book from a <unk>
You can flip through the book and point out lines or words with the virtual tactile sensor that is below every floating screen.
The architects can stretch or rotate their models directly with their hands.
So in these examples, we are going to focus on the digital world.
And if we invest the roles and we make the digital information come up to us?
<unk> many of us will have bought and put things on the Internet.
Now that doesn't have to worry about it.
What I have here is a virtual <unk> on the Internet.
This is the vision that you get from a device on your head or <unk> when the system understands the geometry of your body.
If we took this idea further, I thought, instead of just going to see pixels in space, how can we make it physical as we can <unk> and <unk>
How would a future like this?
At the MIT Media Lab with my graduate Hiroshi Ishii, and my collaborator <unk> Post, we created this only physical pixel <unk>
This magnet, <unk> behaves like a 3D pixel in space, which means that both the computer as users can move the object anywhere inside this little three-dimensional space.
<unk> what we did was <unk> gravity and control the movement through a combination of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
And when we programming the object, we release it from the restrictions of time and space, which means that human movements can <unk> and go back to reproduce and stay in the physical world.
You can teach them physically and physically and at distance and the famous shot of Michael Jordan, can reproduce as a physical reality that we want to.
Students can use it as a tool to understand complicated concepts like the movement of planets, the physics, and unlike the monitors or the textbooks, this is a real and palpable experience that you can touch and feel.
But what's more fascinating than changing the physical part of the computer is to imagine how to program the world is going to change our everyday physical activities.
As you see, digital information is not just going to show us something but to start acting directly about us as part of the physical world that surrounds us without that we have to <unk> from our world.
So we started the talk today talking about a barrier, but if you get that barrier, the only limit that's left is our imagination.
Thank you.
I was <unk> to become a <unk> for two years in <unk> China, in the 1960s.
When I was in first grade, the government wanted to go to a school to athletes with all expenses payments.
But my tiger mother said, "No."
My parents wanted me to become engineering, like them.
After surviving the Islamic Revolution, they believed that there was only a very accurate path toward <unk> a safe job, and <unk>
No matter if I work or not.
But my dream was to be an American opera singer from it.
This was me in my imaginary piano.
An opera singer must start <unk> from very young to learn the <unk> so I tried everything I could to go to the opera school.
I had to write to the director of the school and the host of a radio program.
But no adult gave him the idea.
No adult took me seriously.
I was just my friends, but they were children, without authority, like me.
So at the age of 15 years old, I knew it was too much more to train.
My dream is never <unk>
<unk> that during the rest of my life a second class of second class was the only thing I could aspire to.
And this was so unfair.
So I solved another <unk>
No one to me. I wanted to <unk> OK.
I went to the books.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- I came to America in 1995, and what were the first books that I read here?
Those who were <unk> in China, of course.
"The Good <unk> is about human <unk>
And it's not a <unk> <unk>
The Bible is interesting, but strange.
That's a topic for another day.
But the fifth commandment for me was a <unk> <unk> to your father and your mother."
<unk> I said. "It's so different, and much better than <unk>
So it became my tool to get out of this <unk> guilt trap.
The encounter with a new culture was also a place to my reading <unk>
So many perspectives.
For example, at the beginning, this map seemed to me out of place because this is what the students in China learn.
I had never occurred to me that China didn't have to be in the center of the world.
A map involves the perspective of people.
<unk> reading is not new.
It's a common practice in the academic world.
There are up to research camps like comparative religion and literature.
<unk> and <unk> gives academics a deeper understanding of a subject.
And I thought that if reading comparative reading worked for research, why don't you do it in the life of life.
So I started reading books.
They can be <unk> <unk> from Walter <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> by David <unk> who were involved in a <unk> or friends with <unk> experiences.
By <unk> the <unk> are economic and spiritual <unk>
For Buddha, they're all <unk> lust, fear and <unk>
If you know another language, it's fun to read your favorite books in two languages.
<unk> <unk> Thomas <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- instead of getting lost in translation, I found that you can win a lot of it.
For example, it's through the translation that I realized that <unk> in Chinese literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> in Chinese, it literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
The books opened me a magic door to connect with people from the past and the present.
I know it wasn't going to be <unk> or powerless ever.
Having a <unk> dream really is nothing compared to what many other people have <unk>
I've come to believe that I'm not the only purpose of a dream.
Their most important purpose is to connect to the place of dreams, where the dreams, where happiness comes from.
Until a <unk> dream can do that for you.
And it's because of the books, which I'm here, happy, living again with purpose and clarity, most of the time.
So the books always <unk>
Thank you.
Thank you.  Thank you.
When I was in my <unk> I saw my first <unk> client
I was a graduate student in clinical psychology, in Berkeley.
She was a <unk> woman named <unk>
Alex went to the first session using jeans and a <unk> came up on the couch of my office and grabbed my shoes and told me that I wanted to talk about his problems with men.
When I heard this, I was so <unk>
My roommate had a <unk> as a <unk>
And I had a <unk> I wanted to talk about men.
I thought I could handle it.
But I didn't.
With the biblical stories that Alex led to the <unk> it made me easy to just move your head while you get the solution.
<unk> are the new <unk> he said, Alex, and for what I looked like, she was right.
You start to work later, she got kids later, to death later.
For sure, as Alex and I had time to eat.
But shortly afterwards, my <unk> pushed me to press Alex who would talk about his life <unk>
I was <unk>
I said, "Yes, it's coming up with guys under his category, <unk> <unk> but it's not like it was to marry it."
And then my squad <unk> said, "No, no, but maybe you get married with the next.
In addition, the best time to work on the marriage of Alex is before they were <unk>
This is what psychologists call a <unk>
It was when I realized that <unk> are not the new <unk>
Yes, people feel my head after what they were doing, but this didn't make the <unk> of Alex to be a pause in its development.
This made the <unk> of Alex were the perfect moment and we were <unk>
So I realized that this kind of benign cooperation was a real problem and had real consequences, not just for Alex and his loving life, but for the careers, families and the future people all over the place.
There are 50 million people in the United States, today.
This means about 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent if you think that no one comes to age the age without going to happen before the <unk>
Hands up if you're in your <unk>
I want to see the <unk>
Oh, great. They're amazing.
If they work with <unk> they love a <unk> you remove the dream of a <unk> -- I want to see. It's fine. <unk> really matter.
This is not just my view. These are the facts.
We know that 80 percent of the key moments in life will happen to the 35 years.
This means eight of every 10 decisions and experiences and moments of moments -- that gives your life to have happened to be 30 and <unk>
<unk> people are not <unk>
This audience is going to be okay, I think.
We know that the first 10 years of a career have an exponential impact on the amount of money that we have.
We know that more than half of Americans are married, they live or they're coming out with their future partner at 30 years.
We know that the brain ends up its second and last stage of growth in their <unk> and they are <unk> for <unk> which means that if there's something you want to change themselves, now it's the time to change it.
We know that personality changes more times during their <unk> than at any time of life and we know that the female fertility comes to the top 28, and things become complicated to <unk>
<unk> are the time to get them on their body and their options.
When we think about the development of the child, we all know that the first five years are critical for language and attachment to the brain.
It's a moment in which your everyday life and common life has an impact on the person who are <unk>
But what we don't hear is that there is something called adult development and our <unk> are a critical moment in adult development.
But this is not what the people are listening.
The newspapers talk about changes in the line of the time of <unk>
The researchers call the <unk> an extended <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to the <unk> as <unk> and <unk>
It's true.
As a culture, we've considered a <unk> which is actually the decade that defines the <unk>
Leonard Leonard said that to achieve great things, you need a plan and not enough time.
It's not it?
What do you think happens when you give a <unk> in your head and say, you have another 10 years to start your <unk>
There's nothing.
They stole that person the sense of urgency and his ambition and nothing happens.
And then every day, all the very interesting people like you or your children and daughters come to my office and say something like this: "I know my boyfriend, is not good for me, but this relationship. I'm not just killing time."
Or they say, "Everybody says that while you start a career before the 30, everything will be good."
But then it starts to sound like this: "My <unk> are for <unk> and I still have nothing to show you.
I had a better credit day that I graduated from <unk>
And then it starts to sound like this: "My dating during the <unk> were like the game of chairs.
They were all running, but then at some point around the 30, it turned the music and everybody started to sit down.
I didn't want to be the only one who would be standing, so I sometimes think I married my husband because he was the nearest chair when he had <unk>
Where are the <unk> here?
Don't do that.
Well, that sounds a bit extreme, but they don't get <unk> the risks are very high.
When you leave a lot of things for the <unk> there is a huge pressure on the top and so many of you start a career, pick a city, to choose a mate, and have two or three children in a much more short time.
A lot of these things are not <unk> and there's research that start to show, which is a lot more difficult and stressful to do everything in the <unk>
The middle-aged crisis is not about buying red sports cars.
It's about realizing that you can't have the race you want now.
They realize that you can't have the son you want now, or you can't give a brother to your son.
A lot of <unk> and <unk> you see themselves, and to me, sitting in the room, and they talk about their <unk> "What was you doing? What was you thinking?"
I want to change what the people are doing and thinking.
Here's a story about how it might be.
It's a story about a woman named <unk>
At 25, Emma came to my office because I was, in his own words, having a identity crisis.
He said he would like to work in art or in entertainment, but you still couldn't decide, so I spent the last few years working as <unk>
As it was cheaper, he lived with a boyfriend, who showed more <unk> than ambition.
And in spite of living a very difficult <unk> his previous life had been even more difficult.
<unk> often in our <unk> but then she gets up to say, "You don't choose your family, but you can choose their friends."
Well, one day Emma got his head on his legs and he cried for almost every time.
I had just bought a new book for <unk> and he had gone all the morning and I had the whole morning with her many <unk> but then you look at the empty space that follows after the words <unk> in the emergency case, please call <unk>
I was about to <unk> when he saw me and said, "Who is going to be for me if I have a car accident.
Who is going to take care of me if I get <unk>
At that moment, it took me a lot of work to resist and I don't say, <unk>
What Emma needed was not a <unk> of truth <unk>
Emma needed a better life, and I knew this was his opportunity.
I had learned a lot since I worked with Alex just to sit while the decade of Emma was going on.
So, for the next weeks and months, I said to Emma three things that all of us would have, or woman, deserves to know.
First of all, I told her to Emma that they were going to get away from that identity crisis and <unk> of identity.
For identity capital, I mean doing something that add value to your person.
Doing something that is an investment in what they want to be after.
I didn't know the future of the <unk> and nobody knows the future of work, but I know this: <unk> of identity capital, identity capital.
So now it's time for the work of the other side of the country, from that company that you want to try it.
I'm not <unk> exploration -- I'm going to make exploration that I shouldn't count, which, by the way, it's not exploration, by the way.
It's <unk>
I said to Emma that would explore jobs and to do it.
Second, I said to Emma that urban tribes are <unk>
The best friends are great to take you to the airport, but the people who come together with friends with a similar minds in terms of who you know about, what do you think about, how to talk about, and where they work.
That new piece of capital, that new person who comes out of it almost always comes from the nearest circle.
The new things come from what they're called the weak <unk> friends of their friends.
Yes, half of the people have a bad job, or they have no work.
But the other half of it, and the weak links are the way we get to this group.
And half of the jobs that I never had was <unk> then, to meet the head of your neighbor is the way you get a job yet.
It's not cheating. It's the science of how information is happening.
For the last but not least, Emma believed that you don't choose their family, but I know their friends.
This was true when I was growing up, but as <unk> Emma would soon give her family when they have a partner and shape her own family.
I said to Emma that the time to choose their family had come.
Perhaps you think that 30 is better age to sit in head than 20 or even 25 and I agree with you.
But to choose the person who you live right now, or you are now going to tell you now when everyone on Facebook are starting to walk towards <unk> is not progress.
The best time to work in your marriage is before you have, and that involves being so intentional in love as you're at work.
<unk> your family must be a conscious choice of who and what they want instead of just doing it will work or kill time with anyone who will take them to you.
So what happened to <unk>
Well, we looked at that <unk> and she found a quarter of a room who was working in an art museum in another state.
This weak bond helped him get a job there.
That job supply gave a reason to leave the boyfriend, who alive.
Now, five years later, it's <unk> of events in museums.
This married man who chose <unk>
<unk> his new career, loves her new family, and I send myself a letter to say, "Now the emergency spaces of emergency cells are not <unk>
The story of Emma may sound easy, but that's what I love to work with <unk>
It's very easy to help you.
<unk> are like airplanes coming out of Los Angeles, who come out somewhere in the West.
Just before the <unk> a slight match in its trajectory makes the difference between land in Alaska or in <unk>
In the same way, at 21 or at 25 or even the <unk> a good conversation, a good TED Talk can have huge effects in the years or even in the next generation.
This is my idea that was spreading to all the people who know.
It's as simple as what I learned to say to <unk>
This is what I've now got the privilege of telling people like Emma all day: <unk> are not the new <unk> <unk> their <unk> get <unk> and use your <unk> to use their weak bonds choose to your family.
They don't get to define what they didn't know or what they didn't do.
They're deciding your life today.
Thank you.
When I was 27 years old, I left a very hard job in management management for a job that was even more <unk> the <unk>
I went to teach them mathematics to graduate students in New York City schools.
And as any teacher, I made tests and tests.
I give them tasks.
When I was going, <unk> grades.
What struck me about was that I.Q. was not the only difference between my best and my worst students.
Some of those who had a better performance didn't have <unk> <unk>
Some of my smartest kids were not doing so well.
And that got me thinking.
The kind of thing you need to learn in mathematics in seventh grade, sure, are <unk> <unk> <unk> the area of a <unk>
But these concepts aren't impossible and I was very convinced that each of my students could learn the lesson if they worked hard and for time enough.
After several years of <unk> I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a better understanding of students and learning from a <unk> perspective from a psychological perspective.
In education, the only thing we know about how to measure a better way.
But what if you have success in school and in life depends on much more than the ability to learn in a rapid and easy?
So I left the classroom and I went to college to become a <unk>
I started studying children and adults in all sorts of <unk> <unk> and in every study, my question was, who has success here and why?
My research team and I went to the <unk> West <unk>
We're trying to predict what <unk> <unk> in military training and who are <unk>
We went to the National <unk> of <unk> and we tried to predict what children are going on, as far as possible in competition.
We studied <unk> teachers working in really difficult neighborhoods, which teachers are still teaching for the end of the school year and of <unk> who will be the most effective person to improve the results of their <unk>
We partnered with private companies, asking yourself, which of these marketers are going to keep their job <unk>
And who is going to make more money?
In all those very different contexts, it emerged a feature as an important <unk> of success.
And it wasn't social intelligence.
It wasn't the good look, physical health and wasn't the I.Q.
It was <unk>
<unk> is passion and <unk> to reach very long-term goals.
<unk> is to have resistance.
The determination is clinging to his future, day after day, not only for the week, not only for the month, but for years and working really hard to make that future a reality.
The determination is living life as if it was a <unk> not a <unk>
A few years ago, I started studying determination in public schools in Chicago.
I asked thousands of high school students to make my books, and then I waited for about more than a year to see those who are <unk>
It turns out that the children with more determination had significantly increased more likely to <unk> even when the <unk> in every feature that I could measure, things like family income, the results of the evidence -- even the safety of the children when they were in school.
So it's not only in West Point or in the National <unk> of <unk> where <unk> is also in school, especially for children at risk of <unk>
For me, the most shocking thing about determination is the little thing that we know about, how little you know about the science of its development.
Every day, parents and teachers ask me, "How do I develop <unk>
What do I have to do to teach children a spiritual ethic of work?
How do I keep them motivated for the long <unk>
The most honest answer is, I don't know.  What I know is that talent doesn't give you <unk>
Our data shows very clearly that there are many talented individuals who just don't go ahead with their <unk>
In fact, in our data, the determination is not related or even related to the designers of talent.
Until now, the best idea I've heard about developing the determination is something called <unk> <unk>
This is an idea developed at Stanford University for Carol <unk> and it's the belief that the ability to learn is not a extent that it can change with the effort.
Dr. <unk> has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and it grows in response to the challenge, are much more likely to <unk> when they <unk> because they don't think that failure is a permanent condition.
So the growth mindset is a great idea to develop <unk>
But we need more.
And that's where my speech, because that's where we are.
That's the work we have on the front.
We need to take our best ideas, our stronger intuitions and we need <unk>
We need to measure if they have been successful and we need to be willing to fail, to start to start everything again with the lessons <unk>
In other words, we need to be certain about making our kids more <unk>
Thank you.
<unk> in Taiwan as the daughter of a <unk> one of my most <unk> memories is my mother -- the beauty, the shape and the figure of the Chinese characters.
Since that moment, I was fascinated by this incredible language.
But for a foreign way, it seems to be as <unk> as the Great Wall of China.
In the last few years, I've been wondering if I can break down this <unk> so that you want to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language that I can do it.
I started thinking about how a new method and quickly learn Chinese could be useful.
Since I was five years old, I started learning how to draw each of the strokes of each character in the right sequence.
I learned new characters every day for the next 15 years.
Since we only have five minutes, it's better than we do it in a faster and simpler way.
A Chinese academic, <unk> 20,000 characters.
You only need a thousand to understand basic complexity.
The first 200 will allow you to understand 40 percent of the basic literature, enough to read from traffic signals, to understand the basic idea of the web pages or the newspapers.
Today I'm going to start with eight to show you how the method works.
Are you ready?
Open your mouth as much as it might be <unk>
They get a mouth.
This is a person who is going to give a walk.
<unk>
If the shape of the fire is a person in both sides, as if I was screaming at a <unk> <unk> <unk> I'm <unk> This symbol is actually <unk> in the shape of the flame -- but I like to believe it is the other way.
This is a tree.
tree tree.
This is a mountain.
The sun.
The moon.
The symbol of the door looks like a couple of doors of an <unk> in the old <unk>
I call <unk> to these eight characters.
They are building blocks so they think many more characters.
One person.
If someone walks back, that's <unk>
As the old said, two are a company, three are crowd.
If a person stretches your arms, this person is saying <unk> this big.
The person within the mouth, the person is <unk>
It's a <unk> as a <unk> inside the whale.
A tree is a tree -- two trees together, we have a forest.
Three trees together, we also have the forest.
Put a table under the tree, we have the <unk>
Put a mouth on the tree, that's a <unk> --  <unk> of remember, because a speaker is quite an idiot.
Remember the fire?
Two inches, it gets very hot.
Three inches, that's a lot of fire.
Put the fire under the two trees, that's <unk>
For us, the sun is the source of prosperity.
Two suns together, <unk>
Three together, those are <unk>
Put the sun and the moon shining together, that's the <unk>
It also means morning, after one day and a night.
The sun comes out on the horizon.
One door. Put a table inside the door, and it's the <unk> of the door.
Put a mouth inside the door, asking questions.
<unk> played someone at home?
This person is getting hidden from a door, <unk> <unk>
On the left, we have a woman.
Two women together, they're <unk>
Three women together, be careful is <unk>
So we've already spent for almost 30 characters.
By using this approach, the first eight radical eight will allow you to build 32.
The next group of eight characters build other 32.
So with every little effort, you will be able to learn a couple of hundreds of characters, which is the same thing that you learn a Chinese <unk>
So after I met the characters, we started creating sentences.
For example, the mountain and the fire together, we have a mountain of fire. It's a <unk>
We know that Japan is the Earth <unk>
This is a sun placed in the beginning, because Japan is east of China.
So a sun next to the start, we created Japan.
One person behind Japan, what do we have?
A Japanese person.
The character on the left are two stacked mountains on the other.
In the ancient China, that meant in exile, because the Chinese <unk> are <unk> their political enemies beyond the mountains.
Today, the exile has become out.
A mouth that tells you to go out is a <unk>
This is a slide to remind remind you that I have to stop talking and down the stage. Thank you.
What I prefer to be dad is the movies I get to see.
I love to share my favorite films with my <unk> when my daughter was four years old, and we saw the magician of Oz together.
The movie was the imagination for months.
His favorite character was <unk> of course.
He gave him a good excuse to use a brilliant dress and take a magic wand and take a magic wand and take a magic wand and take a magic wand to get it.
But when you see that film so many times, you get to understand that it's extraordinary.
We now live and we raised our children in a kind of <unk> industrial game of <unk>
However, the Oz of Oz was an event that itself.
It didn't start that trend.
The trend really took up 40 years later with, interestingly enough, another film whose <unk> a metal boy and a <unk> <unk> to a girl in the <unk>
You know what I'm talking about?
There's a big difference between these two films, there's a couple of big differences between the <unk> magician, and all the movies that we see today.
One is that there are very little violence in the <unk> magician there.
The monkeys are pretty aggressive, like <unk>
But I think if the Oz of Oz would do today, the magician would say, <unk> you're the salvation of Oz like the self-fulfilling <unk>
We had some magical shoes to defeat the military -- created by the evil <unk>
But that's not what happens.
Another single thing in the Oz of the Oz is that the most conservative characters and even <unk> are women.
I started to see this when I did see "Star <unk> to my daughter, a few years later, and the situation was different.
At that moment, I also had a child.
Just three years.
It was not invited to the projection because it was still very small for that.
But it was the second son, and the level of surveillance had been <unk>  So she was familiar in the room and she was impressed as a mom in the room and she was standing behind, and I don't think he understood what was happening, but <unk> <unk> everything.
I wonder what <unk>
They would be themes of value, <unk> and <unk>
So I would have a sense that explained one military to overthrowing the government?
<unk> this with the magician of the Oz of <unk>
How would he win Dorothy his movie?
In doing good <unk> with everyone and being a <unk>
It's the kind of world that I want my kids to grow up with, OK? And not a world of men that <unk> which is where we are.
Why are there as much valuable capital force in the movies for our children, and as little as the path of brick <unk>
There's a lot of literature about the impact of male violence in male violence in the girls, and they should be <unk> It's very good.
I haven't read so much about how children react to this stimulus.
I know by experience that the princess <unk> doesn't give me the proper framework that I would have served to navigate the world of adults who are <unk>  I think at the moment of the first <unk> I really hoped that the U.S. began to appear because it's the end of the film, right?
My search is done, I have <unk>
Why are you standing there?
I don't know what I should do.
The movies are focused on <unk> to <unk> and get their reward, and they don't leave time for other relationships or other <unk>
It's almost like being a child, you have to be a <unk> animal, and if you're a girl, you have to use a <unk> suit.
There are a lot of exceptions, and to defend the <unk> of Disney before any of you.
But they send a message to children, even though they guys, they're not really your goal.
They do a phenomenal job by teaching girls how to defend against the <unk> but they don't necessarily show the kids how to defend their <unk>
There's no model for them.
We also have some great women who write new stories for our children, and so real and lovely ones like <unk> and <unk> but they don't stop being films of war.
Of course, the most successful issue of all time is still coming up in classic and every one of them about the adventure of a child or a man, or two men who are friends, or a man and their son, or two men who raised a child.
Until many of you are thinking, this year, finally came out.
I recommend all of you. It's already available in shops.
Remember what criticism was when he came out of it.
I can't believe that Pixar has made a movie of a <unk>
It's very good. Don't let that <unk>
Well, none of these films happens to <unk>
I don't know if you've heard about this.
It's still not roots and already <unk> but maybe we're going to start a movement.
<unk> <unk> is a comics, and in the middle of the 1980s, I recorded a conversation that had had a friend of a friend of the movies you saw.
And it's very simple. There are only three questions that must be <unk> in the movie, there's more of a female character who has lines?
So, you have to fulfill the <unk>
These women talk to each other at some point in the movie?
Their conversations are about something else from the kid that you like to <unk>  All right? Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Two women who exist and talk about each other.
<unk> I've seen, and yet very rarely I see it in the movie that we know and love.
In fact, this week, I went to see a very good quality movie, <unk>
Right? <unk> of <unk> success -- an idea of consensus that it's a Hollywood Hollywood movie.
<unk> not the test of <unk>
And I don't think that <unk> because a lot of the movie, I don't know if you've seen it, a lot of the film happens in a embassy where men and women are hidden in the <unk> crisis.
We have a lot of scenes of men who have deep and painful conversations in this <unk> and it's the great time for one of the actors to get a look at the door and say, <unk> to bed, <unk>
This is Hollywood.
So let's go in the numbers.
In 2011, of the 100 <unk> movies, how many of them believe they have protagonists <unk>
<unk> Not bad.
It's not the same percentage that the number of women that we've chosen recently to Congress, then it's fine.
But there is a bigger number that this is going to <unk> this room.
Last year, The New York Times published a study that the government had done.
This is what he said, right?
In the United States, one in five women says it's been sexually assaulted in their life.
I don't think it's the blame of mass entertainment.
I don't think the movies for children will have something to do with that.
Nor do I believe that music music or pornography are closely <unk> but something is wrong, and when I hear that statistics, one of the things that I think is there's a great amount of sex.
Who are those <unk> What are they <unk>
What do they not get <unk>
They're <unk> the story of a male hero is to defeat the <unk> with violence and then collect the reward, which is a woman who has no friends and not <unk>
We are <unk> that story?
You know, as a parent with the privilege of raising a daughter as those of you who are doing the same thing, we found this world and this very startling statistic and we want to do it.
We have tools to our job as <unk> <unk> and we hope that it will happen, but I have to ask, <unk> <unk> is going to be <unk> if, at the same time, active or <unk> we're educating our children to keep their own <unk>
I mean, I think the Netflix list is a way to do something really important, and here I mean mostly parents.
I think we need to show our kids a new definition of <unk>
The definition of the masculinity is radically changing.
You have read about how the new economy is changing the role of the home and the <unk>
It's all changing.
When I asked my daughter what was his favorite favorite character from "Star <unk> Do you know what you <unk>
<unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
What do you have in common?
Maybe it's not just the bright dress anymore.
I think they're experts.
I think these are the two people in those films that know more than anyone, and they love to share their knowledge with other people to help them reach their potential.
They are leaders.
I like that kind of stories for my daughter, and I like that kind of stories for my son.
I want more stories like that.
I want to be less stories where I tell my <unk> <unk> and I fight only more stories where their job is to join a team, maybe a team led by women, helping other people to improve and be better people, like the magician <unk>
Thank you.
I lived in Maine, and one of the things I liked was looking for sea biscuits on the coast of Maine -- because my parents told me that that would be lucky.
But you know, it's hard to find these <unk>
They are covered with sand and it's hard to see them.
However, over time, I was going to tell you to <unk>
I started to see shapes and patterns that helped me <unk>
This became a passion for finding things in love for the past and <unk>
And finally, when I started studying <unk> I realized that to see with my own eyes not enough.
Because, suddenly, in Egypt, my little beach in Maine had grown up to one of 21 miles of length with the <unk>
And my sea biscuits had grown up to the size of cities.
This is really what led me to use satellite pictures.
To try to make a map of the past, I knew I had to see it differently.
So I want to show you an example of how different we see the <unk>
This is a place located in the eastern delta in Egypt called <unk>
And the place, in the naked eye, it seems to be brown but when we use the infrared and we process it using <unk> <unk> suddenly the place looks like pink pink <unk>
What you're seeing is the real chemical changes of the landscape caused by building materials and the activities of the ancient Egyptian.
I want to share with you how we've used satellite data to find an old city, called <unk> lost for thousands of years.
<unk> was the old Egypt of the old Egypt for more than 400 years in a time of time called the World Bank about 4,000 years ago.
The place is in <unk> Egypt, and it's really important because in the Ottoman Empire there was this great revival of the ancient art <unk> architecture and religion.
<unk> have always known that <unk> I was located somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings that <unk> <unk> into the red circles here, but somewhere inside this huge array of <unk>
This area is massive, it's about <unk> by <unk> kilometers.
Before, the Nile <unk> right next to the <unk> and as it changed over time, moved to this and covered the entire city.
So how do you find a city <unk> in a <unk> landscape.
And I'm going to try to find out the random equivalent to looking for a needle in a <unk> with the eyes <unk> and using baseball.
So we use NASA data from NASA to make a map, very subtle changes.
So we were able to see where the <unk>
But you can see more <unk> and it's even more interesting -- this area is actually in the circle here, which we thought might be the location of <unk>
So we collaborated with Egyptians who are doing labor jobs, you can see it here.
When I say <unk> it's like the shots of showing it in ice, but instead of layers of climate change, we look for layers of human occupation looking for us.
Five feet down, underneath a thick thick layer in fact, found a dense layer of <unk> objects.
This means that in this possible location of <unk> five feet down, we have a <unk> layer of a number of hundreds of years that date back from the Ottoman Empire exactly the same period that we think is <unk>
We also found <unk> jobs and <unk> and <unk> which shows that there was a workshop workshop there.
This might seem like it's not a lot, but when we think about the most common stones used in the jewelry of the Empire
So, we have a dense <unk> of occupation that goes back from the Middle Empire in this place.
We also have evidence of an elite jewelry shop, which shows that what's been there, was a very important city.
We don't find any <unk> here, but we would find it in a very close future to <unk>
And even more importantly, we have the resources to train young Egyptians in the use of satellite technology so they can also make great discoveries.
I want to finish with my favorite quote from the Ottoman Empire probably written in <unk> 4,000 years ago.
Let me share knowledge is the highest of all <unk>
There's nothing like that on the ground.
So according to TED it was not founded in 1984 <unk> C.
Do ideas happen really started in 1984 World, in a lost city not for a long time and found from the top.
It certainly puts the <unk> in perspective.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I want to invite you to close your eyes.
Imagine standing outside, in front of the door of <unk> home.
I want you to pay attention to the color of the door, the material that he's made.
Now let's take a group of <unk> <unk> in bicycles.
They are competing in a racing race and they go in the direction to their <unk>
I need you to see this <unk>
They're <unk> they're <unk> they're <unk>
They collide against the door of their house.
There are bikes flying all over the parts, wheels on the wheels that they end up in <unk> places -- the threshold of the door, you know.
<unk> in the hall, or what's going on to the other side of the door, and look at the quality of the light, the light shining on the <unk> of the <unk>
It's waving with your hand.
From his chair, on a brown horse.
It's a horse that speaks speech.
You can feel your blue <unk> by doing on your nose.
You can smell the <unk> and you can go into the mouth of the mouth.
<unk> on one side and enter their living room.
Already in the room, and making it much use of your imagination, imagine Britney <unk>
He's with little clothes, dancing on her <unk> singing <unk> singing <unk> One second <unk>
Now let's go to the kitchen.
The ground has been coated with a yellow bricks and from the oven, come to you <unk> the Man of <unk> the <unk> and the Len of "The Wizard of <unk> <unk> of the hands, jumping towards you.
Okay. Open your eyes.
I want to tell you about a particular contest that takes every spring in New York City.
It's called the <unk> <unk> of the United States."
I was going to cover this event a few years ago as a <unk> journalist, waiting, suppose, that this was like the end of a <unk> <unk>
There were several men and a few different ages of hygiene.
They were <unk> hundreds of numbers -- look at them just once.
We have the names of tens and tens of strangers.
I took whole poems in just minutes.
<unk> to see anyone could memorize the order of a deck of <unk>
And I was like, "This is <unk>
These people must be true of nature.
And I started talking to some of the competitors.
This one guy named Ed <unk> who had come from England and he has one of the best <unk>
I said, "Well, when you realized you were a <unk>
Ed said, "I'm not a brilliant person.
Actually, I have an average memory.
Everybody who participate in this competition are saying they have normal memory.
We said, "We have trained us to perform these miraculous acts of memory using some old techniques invented by <unk> 2,500 years ago in Greece, the same techniques that he used to memorize their narratives -- and that academics failed used to memorize books.
And my reaction was, <unk> How did I not hear this <unk>
We were standing out of the competition, and <unk> and <unk> who is a wonderful and bright <unk> although a little <unk> he said, <unk> you are an American journalist.
You know Britney <unk>
And I said, "What? No, why?
Because I'd like to teach Britney <unk> how to memorize the order in a deck of <unk> live on national TV.
That would show the world that anybody can do it."
And I said, "Well, I'm not Britney <unk> but maybe you can teach me me.
I mean, you have to start for something <unk>
And that was the beginning of a very strange journey to me.
I ended up spending most of the year next year, not just training my memory, but also <unk> trying to understand how it works, why sometimes it doesn't work and what their potential.
I met a lot of really interesting people.
This is a man named <unk>
He is <unk> very probably with the worst memory in the world.
His memory was so bad that I didn't even remembered that I had a problem of <unk> it's amazing.
Somebody was incredibly tragic, but it was a window that lets you see how far our memory makes us who we are.
On the other end of the spectrum I met this man.
This is Kim <unk> He's based on the role of <unk> <unk> in the movie <unk>
We went together in the public library in Salt Lake City -- <unk> <unk> was <unk>
And when I came back, I read a lot of treaties on the memory written by something over 2,000 years ago in Latin, in <unk> and then in the Middle Ages.
And I learned a lot of really interesting things.
One of the most interesting things that I learned is that there was a time when this idea of having <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> it wasn't a thing as rare as you can see today.
A long time ago, people invest in their memory, to provide their minds.
These techniques have made possible our modern world, but we also have changed.
They have changed <unk> and I would argue that they've changed also a cognitive change.
As we almost have no need to remember, sometimes it seems to have we forgotten how to do it.
One of the last places on our planet where you still find people passionate about this idea of a disciplined and disciplined memory and <unk> is this unique competition of memory.
It's actually not that <unk> there's a <unk> like this all over the world.
I was <unk> I wanted to know how these people do.
A few years ago, a group of University College in London invited a memory of memory champions in the lab.
They wanted to know: Is it going to be brains in some ways, structural structural of the rest of us?
The answer was, no.
Is it more intelligent than the <unk>
They gave them a cognitive test, and the answer was actually no.
There was a really interesting difference between the brains of memory memory and the subjects of control with the <unk>
When they put them in a <unk> MRI scanner, you put your brains while <unk> numbers, faces and forms of <unk> they found that in memory champions <unk> different parts of the brain, different people in the other.
They were actually <unk> or seemed to <unk> a part of the brain that involves spatial memory and navigation.
Why? There's something we can learn from this?
The tournament of competitive <unk> is driven as a armed career in where each year comes up with someone with a new way of remembering more things, and then the rest of competitors should get a day.
This is my friend Ben <unk> three times of memory.
On his desk in front of him, there are 36 <unk> of <unk> <unk> which he's about to try to memorize in an hour, using a technique that he invented and only he <unk>
He used a similar technique to memorize the precise order of <unk> digits <unk>
In half an hour. Yeah.
And while there is a huge amount of ways to remember things in these competence, absolutely all of the techniques used to be reduced to a single concept that psychologists call <unk> <unk>
It illustrates with a elegant paradox known as the <unk> paradox. It says the following: I say to two people who remember the same word -- I'm telling you to you: <unk> there's a man named <unk>
That's your <unk>
And then I ask you, <unk> that there's a <unk> <unk>
And when I go back later, and I wonder <unk> that word I told you about a <unk>
So what would you find?
The person who was told that his name is Baker -- it's unlikely to remember the same word that the person who was telling you that your job is <unk>
The same word, different capacity. That's weird.
What happens here?
Well, the name Baker, really doesn't mean nothing to you. It doesn't have any relationship to you.
With all the other memories they dance through his head.
But the word, <unk> We know <unk>
They use <unk> <unk> white hats.
They have <unk>
They get good when they come home to work.
Probably <unk> some <unk>
And when you get that word for the first time, we started putting <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> at some time.
One of the most elaborate techniques to do this dates back a half thousand years ago in Greece <unk>
It's known as the <unk> of the <unk>
The story says this: There was a poet called <unk> which I attended a <unk>
They had hired it as entertainment, as a entertainment, because before, if you wanted to give a very good party, it was not brought to a <unk> you would get to a <unk>
He stood up to me <unk> his memory, and he was <unk> and so soon it was, the hall of the <unk> <unk>
<unk> everybody.
But not only killed everyone, but it shattered the bodies of <unk> <unk>
No one could say who was there, nobody could remember where you were sitting there.
So you couldn't get the <unk>
One tragedy behind the other.
He stood out the one -- only survivor, in the middle of the rubble, closed the eyes and realized that with the eyes of his mind, I could see where I had been sitting next to me.
I took the family of the <unk> hand to where their loved ones were.
What <unk> pick up at that moment is something that we all know more or less <unk> and it doesn't matter if we're not good at whether we're not good to remember names or phone numbers or instructions for the word of our colleagues, we have visual memory and extreme space.
If you tell me that I would tell you, the first 10 words of the story I just told you about <unk> is very likely to be very hard to do it.
But I would bet that if you asked them to say who was sitting on the horse <unk> in his lobby, they would be able to <unk>
The idea of the memory of memory is to create this building with the eyes of your mind and image you from images with the things that you want to remember.
This is a advice that comes from over 2,000 years ago, to the first treaties of memory, in <unk>
And how does it work?
So let's say you have been invited to the TED stage to give a talk and want to make it from memory, in the same way that he would have made it <unk> if they were invited to <unk> 2,000 years ago.
What you might do is imagine that they're on the door of their house.
And you will come up with some kind of absolutely ridiculous image of crazy and <unk> to help you remember that the first thing that you want to mention is that completely <unk> competition.
And then you can imagine getting into your house, and see the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And that would remind you that they want to introduce your friend Ed <unk>
And then you would see Britney <unk> to remind you that funny anecdote that you want to count.
And then it goes into the kitchen, and the fourth issue that they talk about would be that strange journey that they did for a whole year, and have some friends to help us remember it.
That's like the <unk> <unk> <unk> their narratives -- not word for word, which is going to confuse you, but typical of the typical <unk>
In fact, the term <unk> comes from the Greek Greek <unk> which means <unk>
It's a breath from when people thought about <unk> and in the rhetoric with this sort of spatial terms.
The phrase <unk> would be like the first place in her memory of memory.
I saw this was just fascinating, and I got out of it full of it.
I went to some of these memory skills, and I had the idea of writing a big thing about this <unk> of <unk>
But there was a problem.
The problem was that a memory competition is a <unk> event.
And seriously, it's like looking at a lot of people sitting on <unk> and I mean, the most exciting thing that happens is when someone got <unk>
I'm a journalist and I need to be able to write about something.
I know there are amazing things happening in the minds of these people, but I don't have access.
I realized that if I was going to tell this story, I needed to try to put myself in place.
So I started spending 15 or 20 minutes every morning, before I sit down to see the New York Times, just trying to remember something.
Maybe a poem. Or the names of an ancient school kid bought in a <unk> market.
And I found that this was kind of fun.
I would never expect it to do it.
It was fun, because it wasn't just to train the memory.
What it's actually about to do is to make it better and more the ability to create and imagine these images, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and hopefully <unk> in the eye of the mind.
I was hooked pretty much to this.
This is me, using my standard standard training team for memory competition.
It's a couple of <unk> and some safety glasses covered with tape, leaving only two <unk> because the distraction is the worst enemy of a memory <unk>
I ended up coming back to the same competition that he had covered a year before, and I had the idea that I could be able to get it into a kind of <unk> <unk> experiment.
I thought this could serve a good job for my research.
The problem was that the experiment came out of control.
And I won the <unk> something that I didn't have to happen.
Of course, it's nice to memorize speeches and phone numbers and <unk> but actually this is not the point.
These are just just <unk> tricks.
Because they're based on very basic principles of how the brain works.
And you don't need to be able to build <unk> from the memory or memorize them from <unk> to benefit from a little bit of insights about how your mind.
We often talk about people with a great memory as if it was about a gift -- but it's not the case.
The great memories are <unk>
In the most basic level, we remember when we pay attention.
<unk> when we focus on.
The palace of the <unk> these memory techniques are just shortcuts.
In fact, they're not even <unk> really.
They work because they make us <unk>
It would be sort of deep processing -- a kind of complete attention that most of them are not going to be <unk> around.
But the reality is that there's no shortcuts.
That's how things do <unk>
And if there is something that I want to leave you with today is what I think -- the <unk> that I couldn't even remember that I had a memory problem, I left me, which is the notion that life is the sum of our memories.
How much are we willing to lose what is already our short existence -- in the <unk> or <unk> not by paying attention to the human being in front of us, who walks up to our side, we will be so <unk> that we don't even bother to process in <unk>
I learned firsthand that there are incredible memory capabilities in all of us.
But if you want to live a living, you must be the kind of person who remembers remember.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you about the last 30 years of the history of architecture.
It's a lot to cover 18 minutes.
This is a complex issue, so it was just a <unk> <unk> New Jersey.
Because 30 years ago, I'm from <unk> Jersey, I was six years old, and I lived there in my parents in a village called <unk> and this was my child's bedroom.
In the corner, from my bedroom, I was the bathroom I shared with my sister.
And between my bedroom and the bathroom, there was a balcony that gave the living room.
And there were all the time looking at the television. So every time I was coming out of my room to the bathroom, and every time I went out of my room to the bathroom, and I would go back in a towel -- all of me.
And I was like this.
It was <unk> I hated it.
And I hated that journey, I hated that <unk> I hated that room and that house.
That's architecture.
All right.
Those feelings, those emotions that I felt, is the power of architecture, because architecture is not about mathematics, nor division division of areas, but of those connections emotional connections that we feel in the places that we have.
And it's not surprising that we feel that way, because according to the Environmental Protection Agency -- Americans spend 90 percent of their time under the roof.
I mean, 90 percent of the time are surrounded by architecture.
That's a lot.
Our architecture determines us in ways that we don't even notice.
That makes us a little naive and very, very predictable.
This means that when I show you a building like this, I know what you're going to tell you, you think about <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And I know they think about it because of based on a building built a half thousand years ago by the Greeks.
This is a trick.
It's a <unk> that we use architects to create an emotional connection with the ways we build our buildings.
It's an <unk> emotional connection, we've used this trick for a long, long time.
We used it 200 years to build banks.
We use it in the 19th century to build art.
And in the 20th century, we use it to build houses.
See, these <unk> stable, <unk> <unk> in front of the sea, away from the elements.
This is very, very useful, because building things is terrifying.
It's expensive, it takes a long time and it's very complicated.
The people who are <unk> and governments are always afraid to innovation, and they prefer to use ways they know they're going to work.
So we met buildings like this.
It's a beautiful <unk>
This is the Public Library of <unk> which ended in 2004, in my hometown, and you know, it has a <unk> it has this <unk> <unk> columns, that leave <unk> what <unk> tries to communicate with this <unk> the children, the human values.
But it doesn't have a lot to do with a library today.
That same year, in 2004, the other side of the country, became another library, which looks like this.
It's in Seattle.
This library shows how we use the media in the digital era.
It's a new kind of public equipment for the city, a place to come together, read and sharing.
So how is it possible that in the same year, in the same country, in the same country, two buildings, both so-called libraries, are so different?
And the answer is that architecture works on the beginning of <unk>
On one side is the <unk> architects that are constantly bringing new technologies, new <unk> new solutions for life forms today.
We need to get it out and we went away so much, that we get away from all the people.
And all of the black, this is going to give us -- you think we feel very well, but we're dead in because we have no other option.
We need to go on the other side and connect to those symbols <unk>
So we do that, and we're all happy, but we feel like <unk> so we started to experience <unk> we can swing the pendulum back forward, over and over again. So we've done it in the last 300 years, and of course it is, in the last 30 years.
Well, 30 years ago, I was <unk> from the '70s.
The architects were busy experimenting with the <unk>
It has to do with the concrete.
That can be guess.
<unk> small <unk> <unk>
Really very hard.
So we are approaching the '80s, and we started to incorporate those symbols.
Let's get the pendulum back in the other direction.
We take those ways that we know that like and <unk>
<unk> <unk> and we added a bake and we use a new material.
They love it.
We don't give <unk>
We took <unk> and we made them in a skyscraper that can be <unk> <unk>
The shapes were <unk> won in audacity and <unk>
<unk> became columns.
<unk> grew up to the size of buildings.
<unk>
But it was the '80s, that was great.
We all went through the commercial centers, and we moved to the slums, and in the suburbs, we can create our own erotic <unk>
Those fantasies could be <unk> to the French or the Italian one?
Maybe with a <unk> of bread.
This is what happens to the <unk>
This is what happens to the symbols.
They're easy, they're cheap, because instead of creating new spaces, recreating memories of other places.
I know very well, and you all know this is not the <unk>
This is Ohio.
The architects feel frustrated and we started to <unk> the pendulum again in the other direction.
In the '80s and early '90s, we started experimenting with the <unk>
<unk> the symbols <unk> now we have new design techniques from a computer, and we found ourselves with new <unk> some shapes that are attached to other ways.
This is an academic and <unk> and it's super <unk> One is totally <unk>
Normally, the <unk> <unk> again in the opposite direction.
But then something <unk>
In 1997, this building.
It's the <unk> of Frank <unk>
This building fundamentally changed the relationship of the world with architecture.
Paul <unk> said that Bilbao was one of those rare moments when <unk> <unk> and public <unk> they were completely aware of a building.
The New York Times <unk> this construction of <unk>
<unk> in Bilbao grew up in a half two and a half thousand time ended the building.
So all of a sudden, everybody wanted one of those <unk> Los Angeles, and Los Angeles, and Chicago, New York, Cleveland, <unk>
Everybody wanted one, and Gehry was everywhere.
He was our first star.
But how is it possible that these forms, wild ways, how is it possible to become ubiquitous around the world?
And it happened, because the media <unk> around them and quickly learned that those shapes meant culture and tourism.
We've created an emotional reaction with these shapes.
Same mayors in the world.
So everybody believed that if they had these forms, they had culture and tourism.
This phenomenon at the beginning of the new millennium country happened with other star architects.
And I went to <unk> and <unk> and what happened with these few elite architects at the threshold of the new millennium, actually started to happen with all architecture, media media began to increase the speed of information consumption.
Think for example, how they use architecture.
A thousand years ago, they would have to have walked up to the next town to see a building.
The transport is <unk> you can take a boat, an airplane, you can be <unk>
<unk> technology. You can see in the newspapers, on TV, and in the end, we are all photographers in architecture, and the building is transported beyond their physical location.
The architecture is everywhere, that means that the speed of communications finally has reached the speed of architecture.
Because architecture moves so fast.
It doesn't have a lot of time to think about a building.
It takes a lot of time to build a building, three or four years, and in that time, an architect can design 2, eight, or 100 more buildings, before knowing whether that I designed four years ago was a success or not.
Because there's never been good feedback in architecture.
That's how we met buildings like this.
The <unk> was not a two years old, but 20 years.
For 20 years, we were building buildings like this because we had no idea how much the <unk>
That's never going to go back to <unk> because we are at the threshold of the biggest revolution in architecture from the invention of the <unk> of steel or <unk> and it's the media revolution.
My theory is that when the pendulum applies to the media, it starts to swing faster and faster, as far as it gets to be on both extremes of <unk> and they are effectively <unk> the difference between innovation and symbol, between us, the architects, and the public.
Now we can make pretty much <unk> symbols of something completely new.
I'm going to show you how the system works.
We were <unk> to replace this building that <unk>
This is the center of a village called <unk> in <unk> Island, in the state of New York.
It's a vacation.
But that meant two years before they finished the building, it was a part of the community, and as the drawings looked exactly at the product -- it was not surprises.
The building came to be part of the community, and that first summer, when people started getting and share it in social media, the building stopped being a building, became a means of communication, because these are not just images of a building, are the images that you made of the building.
And as you use it to tell your story, they become part of personal narrative, and that makes it <unk> with the collective memory, and by carrying these symbols, we learn.
I mean, we don't need the Greeks to tell us how to think of architecture.
We can tell each other what we think about architecture, because digital media has not only changed the relationship between us, but have changed the relationship between us and buildings.
Think about a second in those librarians of <unk>
If that building was built today, first of the Internet in pursuit of <unk> <unk>
He said, bombarded with examples of <unk> innovation, about what a library.
That's <unk>
<unk> that can lead to the mayor of <unk> to the people of <unk> and tell you that there's no single answer to what a library can be today.
Let's be part of this.
This abundance of solutions gives freedom to experiment.
It's all different now.
The architects are no longer these mysterious creatures that are using words -- <unk> and complicated, and one is no longer a <unk> audiences who don't have seen before.
The architects can listen, and you don't get <unk> by architecture.
That means that the one is <unk> from one style to another, of one movement, is irrelevant.
In fact, we can go ahead and find right solutions to the problems facing society.
This is the end of the history of architecture, and it means that the buildings in the morning will be very different from the buildings today.
This means that a public space in the ancient city of <unk> can be unique and adapted to the measure of a modern city.
This means that a stadium in Brooklyn can be that, a stadium in Brooklyn, and not a bad imitation of solid brick <unk> based on ideas of what a stadium.
This means that some robots will be able to build our buildings, because we will finally be ready for the shapes that are going to produce.
That means that the buildings will become the <unk> of nature and not the opposite.
This means that a parking garage in Miami Beach, Florida, it can also serve to make sports or to <unk> or even one can be married at night.
This means that three architects can dream with swimming in the East <unk> of New York, and raising half a million dollars of the community attached to around that cause, it's not a client alone.
It means that no building is too small for innovation, like this little pavilion of <unk> so <unk> and <unk> as the animals coming back to us.
Because no longer matter whether it's a cow or a robot who builds our buildings.
It doesn't matter how we built, what we do matters is what we build.
The architects already know how to make more <unk> and more kind.
We've been waiting for all of you.
Finally, we're not on opposite sides anymore.
Find an architect, <unk> and <unk> together to make better buildings, better cities, for a better world, because there's a lot of play.
The buildings not just reflect our society, but they shape the more <unk> spaces, local libraries and households where we formed our children, and the step of the bedroom.
Thank you very much.
This is my <unk> <unk>
It just turned a year and he started walking.
And it does this very typical way of the children in a year, <unk> as if his body was moving too fast for his legs.
It's totally <unk>
And one of the things that I like to do for the moment is look at the mirror.
She really loves her reflection.
<unk> and <unk> and it gives itself these big <unk> <unk>
It's beautiful.
And apparently, all of his friends do this and my mom tells me I used to do it. And it made me think, when did I just do that?
How is it that we suddenly aren't comfortable with our <unk>
Because, apparently, we don't like it.
Every month, 10,000 people are looking at Google: "I'm <unk>
This is <unk> she's 13 years old, and it lives in <unk>
And as any teenager just wants to be dear and fit in.
It's Sunday at night.
It's preparing for the next week in school.
It has a little bit of fear, it's a little confused because, even though your mom says all the time it is beautiful, every day in school, someone says it's ugly.
Between what your mom says and what your friends, or fellow people in school, they say, you don't know who to believe.
So a video of it, it makes it on YouTube, publishes on YouTube, and ask others to leave a <unk> "I'm nice or I'm <unk>
Okay, so far, <unk> has gotten over 13,000 <unk>
Some of these are so <unk> they don't even deserve to think about them.
We talk about a normal healthy teenage teenager who gets these answers into one of the stages of their most vulnerable life stages.
Thousands of people are posting videos like this, in most girls trying to communicate this way.
But what is it doing to do this?
Well, teenagers today are almost never alone.
They're under pressure from being online and available all the time, talking about, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- this is never over.
Never before we've been so connected, in a continuous way, so young as young.
As a mother said, "It's like there's a party in his room every single <unk>
There's just no privacy.
And social pressures that go from the hand with that are <unk>
This environment, that is always connected, is <unk> our children to <unk> based on the number of likes to have and the kinds of comments that they get.
There is no divide between a life online and real life.
It's really hard to know the differences between what's real or what it is.
And also, it's very hard to know the difference between what it's authentic and what it is actually worth.
What is the most important thing in someone in front of someone in front of which is normal in a different context.
And where are you looking for <unk>
Well, you can see the kind of images that are <unk> of the news of girls now.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> our <unk>
The technique of <unk> is now routine.
And <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For those of the <unk> <unk> means <unk>
These trends are associated with women in popular culture today.
It's not hard to see what the young men is?
But the kids are also not immune to this.
Like the superheroes superheroes in sports, and the singers, <unk>
But what is the problem with all this?
Well, we surely want our children to grow healthy and be individuals are <unk>
But in a culture obsessed with the image, we're teaching our children to spend more time and mental effort to their look, the price of all other aspects of their identity.
Things like their relationships, the development of their physical capacities -- their studies and other aspects begin to suffer.
Six of 10 girls prefer not to do something because they think they don't look like nice enough.
These are not <unk> activities.
They are fundamental activities for the growth as human beings and as a taxpayer to society and the field development of the labor development.
31 percent, almost one in three teenagers are not interested in the debates of the classroom -- to participate in the classroom <unk> because they don't want to call the attention for their physical <unk>
One of the five aren't attending at all of the days when they don't feel comfortable about it.
And in the season of tests, if you don't think you are good enough, specifically, if you don't think you're thin, <unk> a smaller note at the average of your fellow who don't care about that as appearance.
And this phenomenon has been widespread in Finland, and China, and China.
And it comes regardless of what actually weigh these young people.
So, to be well clear, we're talking about how you see you not what you're really like.
The low self-esteem on your body is <unk> the academic performance.
And it's also <unk> health.
<unk> with times they do less physical activity, eat less fruit and vegetables, they participate in more diet healthier than they can take them to a food disorder that they can bring to them.
They have low self-esteem.
They are more easily <unk> by the people around them and they're at greater risk of depression.
And we think that's all of this because of what they make more <unk> decisions like the consumption of alcohol and drugs, diets -- dieting surgery, aesthetics, sex and no protection and no <unk>
The pursuit of the perfect body is pushing into the health system, and our government costs billions of dollars every year.
And we're not <unk>
Women who believe they are overweight again, regardless of whether they have any higher rates of <unk>
17 percent of women don't present to a job interview in a day that they don't feel safe in the way you see it.
Think about a moment in what this is doing to our economy.
If we could overcome this, what would we look like for?
<unk> this potential is interest for each of us.
But how do we do that?
Well, speaking, by itself, doesn't take you very far.
It's not enough.
If you really want to change things, you have to do something.
And we've learned that there are three key forms. The first is that we need to instill in trust your own body.
We have to help our teenagers to develop strategies to develop the pressure of the perfect images and build their self-esteem.
The good news is that there are a lot of programs available to do it.
The bad news is that most of these don't work.
I was very surprised when I learned that a lot of programs would be <unk> without realizing it.
So we have to make sure that the program that follows our children will not only have a positive impact, but also a lasting impact on it.
And research studies show that the best programs are focused on six key areas, and the first is the influence of the family, friends and relationships.
These six ways are kind of critical points for anyone willing to provide a education in your body self-esteem that works.
An education is a difference, but dealing with this problem requires each of us to take the charges in the issue, and let's be a better model to follow for women and girls in our own lives.
It's challenging the current status of how women are seen and mentioned in our circles.
It's not good to tell you with the contribution of our political <unk> or the size of your <unk> or the size of their <unk> or the size of an Olympic athlete depends on the fact that it's not a great beauty.
We need to begin to judge people for what they are, not like you see.
We can all begin by doing it by assuming responsibility by the kind of images and comments that we published in our social networks.
We can engage people in their effort and their actions and not in their appearance.
And let me ask you, when was the last time you put a <unk>
In short, we have to work together as communities, as governments and for businesses, to really change our culture, so our children will grow high school in their own person, valuing individuality, diversity, <unk>
We need to put people that are actually making the difference in a <unk>
To make a difference in the real world, let's make them the ones that go out on the big screen, because we will just create a different world.
A world where our children are free to become the best version of themselves, where the way they think they have never been <unk> to be who they are, or reaching what they want in their lives.
Think what this can mean for someone in their lives.
Who are you in mind?
Is it <unk>
Is it <unk>
Is it <unk>
Her <unk> A <unk>
It could be simply the woman who is two seats. What would it mean for her if it was liberated from that voice <unk> in his interior, and he had no long legs -- she had no longer legs -- a more <unk> <unk>
What would it mean for her if we were doing this, and we would say free to his potential for that way?
Right now, the obsession of our culture with the images of the images are attached to us.
But let's get our children to the truth.
So what you think is that the way you see is just a part of your identity, and the truth is that we love them for those who are and so they do, and because they make us feel.
They went to self-esteem in the <unk> of our schools.
So let's change each of us, the way we talk about and we compare to other people.
And <unk> together as a community, from small groups to governments, so that the little <unk> from a year of today, they will become safe agents for themselves tomorrow.
Let's do it.
On November five of 1990, a gentleman named <unk> <unk> entered a hotel in Manhattan and killed the rabbi <unk> <unk> the leader of the League of Defense <unk>
And <unk> initially was the innocent, but I was a prisoner of other minor charges in company, and they started planning attacks at about 12 icons of New York City, including <unk> <unk> and the United Nations.
Fortunately, those plans were <unk> by an FBI FBI <unk>
Sadly, the pump of 1993 in the World Trade Center, couldn't be saved.
Later on, he would be convicted of their participation in that <unk>
<unk> <unk> is my dad.
I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1983, being a <unk> engineer with a loving mother teacher in elementary school -- between the two they did all the possible for giving me a happy childhood,
Only when I was seven years old, our family started to change.
My father taught me a way of Islam, that very few, even most Muslims get to know.
For experience, I saw that when people take time to interact, it doesn't require a lot to get the same things in their life.
However, in all religion, in all human group, there are always a tiny fraction of people who are so inspired by their convictions that thinks that we have to use all the possible means for everybody to live as them.
A few months before he arrest him and explained to me that in the last weekends, he got me and told me that in the last weekends, he and some friends, they had been going to sign Long Island, to practice.
He told me that I would go with him the next day.
We came up with the shooting <unk> which, without knowing our group, was <unk> by the FBI.
When my father touched me: my father helped me hold the <unk> on my shoulder and explained how to aim for about 30 feet.
That day, with the last bullet that shot at the little orange light that shot the little orange light on the goal and, to surprise you, especially me, all the goal broke on fire.
My uncle went back to the other and in Arabic, he said, <unk> <unk>
As a child, a child.
And by all, the comment produced a lot of laughter. But just a few years later I understood what they were so funny.
Did you see in me, the same level of destruction that my father could <unk>
Those people later would be convicted of putting them loaded with 700 pounds of explosives in the World Trade Center, causing causing a explosion that killed six people and hurt other 1,000.
I admired those men.
He called them <unk> which means uncle.
When I turned 19, I already had moved 20 times. That instability during my childhood was not allowed to do a lot of <unk>
Every time I started feeling comfortable close to someone was a moment of packing and going to another city.
As long as I was always my face -- the new class was <unk>
<unk> secret my identity to prevent the white being, but it will be the new of the class, silent class was enough <unk>
So most of the time I spent at home reading books, watching TV or playing video games.
For these reasons I didn't have developed social skills, to put it very under <unk> it wasn't ready for the real world.
I was <unk> opera to judge people, based on <unk> indicators like their race or their religion.
So how could I open the eyes?
One of the first experiences they put to test my way to think was during the presidential election of 2000.
In a <unk> program I was involved in the National Convention in Philadelphia.
My group was <unk> in the subject of juvenile violence, as I had been a victim of <unk> almost my life, was something that I felt a lot of passion.
The members of this group came from various <unk>
One day, at the end of the <unk> I discovered that one of the guys we had done friendship, was Jewish age.
It took several days to go out of the light this detail and realized that there was no <unk> among the two.
I never had had a Jewish friend and frankly I was very proud to have been able to overcome the barrier that all life had been able to believe that it was <unk>
Another crucial moment emerged when I got a summer job in Bush <unk> a <unk> park.
I found myself with people of all kinds of beliefs and cultures. That experience was fundamental in the development of my character.
All life had taught me that <unk> was a sin and for extension, all the gay people were bad <unk>
I happened to have a chance to work with gay actors there, in a show, and I could see that several of them were the <unk> and less critics that I had seen in life.
Having been <unk> as a kid, I developed a sense of empathy towards the suffering of others. But it wasn't easy for me to treat people -- exactly the way I wish to be treated.
And so I could contrast the stereotypes that they had taught me about a child, with the experience of interaction in real life.
I don't know what it is to be <unk> but I know what it's going to be in the way of something beyond my control.
Then came the <unk> <unk>
All night, Jon Stewart asked me to be <unk> honest about my <unk> and helped me see that the race of people, religion or sexual orientation, has nothing to do with character.
In many ways he turned my figure back in a moment where I was desperately desperately <unk>
Sometimes the inspiration can come from the unexpected and that a Jewish comedian would have a better influence in my life that my own father, <unk> was not in vain.
I had a conversation with my mother about how I was changing my way to think, and she told me something to keep in my heart forever, while he's alive.
She looked at me with my eyes tired of someone who's suffered enough <unk> and he said, "I'm tired of <unk>
At that point I realized how much negative energy you need to keep all that hatred in your inside.
My real name is not <unk> <unk>
It changed when my family decided to break the relationship with my father and start a new life.
So why did I decided to go out and put myself in a possible risk?
Well, it's simple.
I've done it because I hope that somebody else is to bring to violence, you can hear my story and understand that there is a better way, that even though I was giving me this ideology in violent ideology and <unk> I didn't have me <unk>
On the contrary, I decided to use my experience to fight terrorism and <unk>
I do it by the victims of terrorism and for their loved ones, because of their loved pain and the losses that terrorism has produced in their lives.
For the victims of terrorism talking, to talk against those acts of <unk> as rejection of my father's actions.
With this one, I put up here as proof that violence is inherent to any religion or race, which children don't have to follow the paths of their parents.
I'm not my dad.
Thank you.  Thank you all.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.
At this moment, there's a film that is projected in their minds.
It's an amazing movie film.
It's in 3D, and it has <unk> sound of what you hear and you see right now. But that's just the beginning.
Your film has <unk> flavor and texture.
You feel your body, your pain, your pleasure.
It has emotions, anger and happiness.
It has memories, as your childhood moments you project in front of your eyes.
And it has constantly a voice superimposed on your flow of conscious thinking.
The heart of the movie are you who experience everything in it.
This film is your flow of consciousness, the subject of the experience of the mind and the world.
Consciousness is one of the fundamental truths of the existence of the human being.
Each of us are conscious.
We all have an internal movie and you and you, you and you.
There's nothing to get more directly.
At least I know I have a <unk>
I have no sense that you're aware of.
<unk> also is the reason to live.
If we were not aware, nothing in our lives would make sense or value.
But at the same time it's the most mysterious phenomenon of the universe.
Why are we <unk>
Why have these films <unk>
Why are we not just the robots that are going to have to produce results without experiencing the movie <unk>
At this moment, nobody knows the answers to those questions.
I suggest that to integrate consciousness to science, you need some radical ideas.
Some people say it's impossible a science of consciousness.
The science, by nature, is objective of it.
<unk> by nature, it's subjective things.
So there can never be a science of consciousness.
Because for almost all of the 20th century, I think of that vision.
psychology is studying behavioral behavior, and the neuroscience is studying the brain, but nobody mentioned consciousness.
Even 30 years ago, when TED started, there was very few scientific jobs about consciousness.
<unk> 20 years ago, everything started to change.
<unk> like Francis Crick and physicists like Roger Bannister said, <unk> is the moment for science to <unk> the <unk>
And since then, there was a real bang, a <unk> of the scientific work of consciousness.
And this work was fantastic. It was great.
But it also has fundamental limitations to the moment.
The center of the science of consciousness in recent years was the pursuit of <unk> correlations between some areas of the brain and some states of consciousness.
We saw some of this guy in the fantastic work that I'd introduced Nancy <unk> a few minutes ago.
We now understand a lot better, for example, the areas of the brain that are related to the conscious experience of seeing faces, or feeling pain or feeling happy.
But this is still a science of <unk>
It's not a science of explanations.
We know that these areas of the brain are related to certain types of conscious experiences, but we don't know why.
I'd like to tell you that this kind of work in neuroscience responds to some questions that we want to explain consciousness about what certain areas of the brain are doing and what they are <unk>
But in a sense, those are the easy problems.
<unk> <unk>
In reality, there is no easy problems with consciousness.
Well, it doesn't address the real central mystery of this <unk> Why all physical processes in the brain has to be accompanied by consciousness?
Why is this an inner movie <unk>
At this moment, we can't understand it.
And you can say, let's give it a few years to neuroscience.
Is it going to turn into another emerging phenomenon like <unk> like life, and we're going to find explanation.
The typical <unk> are all cases of the emerging behaviors -- how they work, how they work, how they work, how they are <unk> and <unk> the living organisms -- all of them are questions about how the goal works.
That could be applied to the human brain to explain some behaviors and the functions of the human brain as a <unk> phenomenon, how we are talking, how we do <unk> all of them are questions about behavior.
But when it comes to consciousness, the questions about behavior are between the easy problems.
But the hard problem, is the question of why all behavior is accompanied by an experienced experience.
And here it is, the standard paradigm of <unk> the standard paradigm of neuroscience, is actually not a lot to say.
I'm a <unk> scientific <unk>
I want a scientific theory of the <unk> that works for a long time, beat me my head against the wall looking for a theory of consciousness in pure terms that would work.
But at the end, I came to the conclusion that that didn't work for <unk> reasons.
I think we were going to get them at this point.
We have a wonderful supply chain, and we have used to this, the physics explains chemistry, chemistry explains biology, biology explains part of psychology.
But consciousness doesn't seem to fit into this scheme.
On the one hand, it's a fact that we're aware of.
On the other, we don't know how to put that idea to our scientific view of the world.
I think consciousness right now, is kind of a <unk> something that we need to integrate to our view of the world, but we don't know how.
With an anomaly like this, you can need radical ideas, I think we need ideas that at the beginning of <unk> crazy before we can deal with consciousness in a scientific way.
There are some possibilities for those crazy ideas.
My friend Dan Dennett, who's here today, has one.
Their crazy idea is that there is no such a hard problem of consciousness.
All the idea of the internal subjective film includes a kind of illusion or confusion.
Actually, what you need to do, is to explain the functions of our brain functions, the behaviors of the brain, and this is the whole thing that needs explanation.
Well, more power for him.
That's the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if we want a theory of purely <unk> consciousness based on the brain.
At the same time, for me and for many others, that vision is pretty close to simply denied than the observation of consciousness is <unk>
But I go in a different direction.
In the time you left, I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think can be <unk>
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is critical.
The physicists are sometimes taking some aspects of the universe as bricks and space, time and mass.
It was <unk> laws which are <unk> as the laws of gravity or quantum mechanics.
These laws and fundamental properties don't explain in terms of any more basic terms.
Rather, it's considered principles, and in there it builds the world.
Sometimes, the fundamental list is <unk>
In the 19th century, <unk> discovered that you can't explain electric phenomena in terms of fundamental concepts -- space, time, mass laws -- so I applied the basic laws of <unk> and he applied the electric charge as a fundamental concept that those laws <unk>
I think that's the situation we find ourselves with consciousness.
If you can't explain consciousness in terms of fundamental ideas -- space, time -- <unk> <unk> then <unk> then for the question of logic, you have to <unk> the list.
The most natural thing would be <unk> consciousness itself as a fundamental brick of nature.
This doesn't mean that it is suddenly not an object of science.
It opens up the path for <unk> scientifically.
So what we need to do is to study the fundamental laws that govern consciousness, the laws that connect consciousness with other concepts -- the space, the time, the weather, mass, physical processes.
The physicists are sometimes saying that we want the fundamental laws that we can put them into a <unk>
The situation of consciousness is something like this.
We want to find very simple laws that we can put them into a t-shirt.
We don't know what laws are, but that's what we need.
The second crazy idea is that consciousness can be universal.
Every system can have a degree of consciousness.
This vision is sometimes called <unk> <unk> by all, <unk> by mind, every system is conscious, not only humans, the dogs, the mice, the mice, even the microbes from Rob <unk> the elementary particles.
Even a <unk> has some degree of consciousness.
The idea is not that photons are smart or to <unk>
It's not that a <unk> can be filled with heartbreak when you think my eyes always traveling the speed of light.
I can never slow down and smell the <unk>
No, so no.
But thinking is that perhaps photons can have some element of <unk> <unk> some precursor to the early <unk>
This may sound a little bit crazy for you.
How would anybody think about something so <unk>
Part of this comes from the first crazy idea, consciousness is a fundamental thing.
If it's fundamental -- like space, time and mass, it's natural to assume that it can also be universal, like others.
It's also worth noticing that although the idea seems to us, it's much less for the people of different cultures, where the human mind seems more a continuum of nature.
One deeper reason comes from the idea that perhaps the simplest and powerful way of finding fundamental laws that we prescribe thinking with the physical process, is <unk> the awareness of information.
Whenever there's information processing.
<unk> of complex <unk> as in a human being, a human consciousness.
<unk> of simple, consciousness <unk>
So a very exciting thing is that in recent years, a <unk> <unk> <unk> took this kind of theory and developed it with mathematicians.
It has a mathematical measure of integration of information, which is called <unk> which measures the level of information integrated in a system.
And it's supposed to be able to do with consciousness.
So in a human brain, there is an incredible degree of high information integration -- a high degree of <unk> a lot of consciousness.
In a mouse there is a kind of a kind of information integration of information integration -- such a significant degree of consciousness quite important.
But when you get to the worms, microbes, the particles, the degree of <unk> <unk>
The level of information integration is smaller, but it's not zero either.
In <unk> theory, there will still be a different level of awareness.
Indeed, a fundamental law of the high degree of <unk> high degree of consciousness.
Moreover, another reason is that <unk> can help us integrate consciousness to the physical world.
And physicists and philosophers have often observed that physics is curiously abstract.
It describes the structure of reality using a lot of equations, but it doesn't talk about the reality that underlying the underlying reality.
So as Stephen Hawking, "Where is the fire of the <unk>
From the <unk> view, the equations of physics can be left as they are, but you can use to describe the flow of consciousness.
That's what physicists do basically describe the flow of consciousness.
According to this vision, consciousness is the one that puts me in the equations.
In that view, consciousness is not outside the physical world as a kind of <unk>
It's right there in the center.
So this vision I think, is the <unk> vision of <unk> our relationship to nature, and it can have social and ethical and ethical and ethical consequences.
Some can be <unk>
I used to think that I should not eat anything that had consciousness, then I should be a <unk>
If you're a <unk> and you accept that vision, you'll get a lot of hungry.
I think by thinking about this, this tends to transform your <unk> whereas what matters in ethical terms, and moral <unk> is not so much the fact of consciousness, but its importance and complexity.
It's also natural to ask for consciousness in other systems, like computers.
What about the artificial intelligence system of Samantha in the movie <unk>
It's <unk>
According to <unk> information, she has a complicated information processing, so the answer is yes, if it's conscious.
If this is right, they have very serious ethical problems about the development of the development of smart computers and the ethical <unk>
Finally, you can ask for the consciousness of life, the planet.
Canada has their own consciousness?
Or at a more local level, an integrated group, like the audience at a TED Talk, and at this moment, we have a collective collective consciousness -- an inner movie for this whole TED group, different from the internal movies in each of the <unk>
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think at least is a question that should be serious.
So this <unk> <unk> is a radical view, and I don't know if it's right.
I'm actually safer for the first crazy idea, that consciousness is a fundamental thing, which is universal.
The vision raises a lot of questions, many challenges, many challenges, like, how those bits of thinking contribute to the kind of complex consciousness that we know and love it.
If we can answer those questions, then I think we're going on the right path towards a theory of serious awareness.
If not, well, it's probably the most difficult problem of science and philosophy.
We can't wait to fix it from night to the morning.
But I think we will finally be able to find it.
Understanding consciousness is the real key, I think, to understand the universe and to understand ourselves.
Maybe we just need the crazy idea.
Thank you.
I grew up in a rural village in Victoria.
He had a very normal, a very normal profile of education.
I went to school, I was excited with my friends with my younger sisters.
It was all very normal.
And when I was 15 years old, a member of my community came up to my parents because I wanted to <unk> for a community prize.
And my parents said, "Well, that's very nice -- but there's a problem.
She has actually no <unk>  And they were right.
I went to school, had good grades. After school, I had a low <unk> in my mother, and spent a lot of time looking at the <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Yes, I know. What contradiction.
But they were right.
I did nothing that was extraordinary at all.
Nothing to be considered as a achievement if we take the disability out of the equation.
Years later, I was in the second part of teaching in the second part of teaching in a high school of <unk> just after about 20 minutes in the middle of <unk> <unk> a guy raised his hand and said, "Hey, when to give your <unk>
And I said, "What <unk>
Well, I had been talking about the law of <unk> for a good 20 minutes.
And he said, "You know, your <unk>
When people in lawn chairs are talking about <unk> things in school?"
Usually in the <unk> hall.
And it was when I realized, this kid had had experiences with disabled people like inspiration.
And we don't are. And it's not the fault of the boy, I mean, that's true for many of us.
For us, the people with disability are not our teachers or our doctors or our <unk>
We are not real people. We are there to fear.
And in fact, I am on this stage, which I do in this wheelchair, and you probably are waiting for you to tell you. Right?  Yes.
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid <unk>
I'm not here to <unk>
I'm here to tell you that they have lied to us in relation to disability.
Yes, they have sold the lie that disability is something <unk> -- a capital <unk>
It's a bad thing and living with a disability, makes you <unk>
It's not something wrong and it doesn't make you <unk>
And in the last few years, we've been able to spread even more this lie through social media.
You may have seen images like this: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk>
Or this <unk> "Your excuse is <unk>
Or this <unk> "Before <unk> <unk>
These are just a couple of examples, but there is a lot of them.
You may have seen one, of the girl without the hands drawing with a pencil held by the mouth.
You may have seen a child who runs with <unk> legs of carbon fiber.
And there's a lot of these images, which are what we call inspiration <unk>
And I use the term porn term -- because we would have a group of people for the benefit of another group of people.
So in this case, we will lead to individuals in the benefit of people without disability.
The purpose of these images is <unk> <unk> so we can see them and think, "Well, thank you very bad that my life, it could be worse.
I could be that guy.
But if you're that person?
I've lost the number of times that I've been approached strangers -- to express that they believe that I'm brave or a source of inspiration, and this was going to happen before my work had a public profile.
It was like I was getting up in the morning and remember my own name.  And this is <unk>
These images, those images are attached to people with disability to benefit from people without disability.
They're there for you to see them and think that things aren't so bad for you, or to put their concerns in perspective.
And life as a disabled person is actually a hard thing.
So let's get some things.
But the things that we do not are the things that you might think.
They're not relative to our bodies.
I use the term <unk> <unk> <unk> deliberately because I was called the so-called social model of disability, which tells us that we are more disabled, because of society we live than because of our bodies or <unk>
So I've lived in this body for a long time.
I'm very <unk> with him.
The things I need to do, and I've learned how to do the best of your capacity as well as you do, and that's what happens with the children of those pictures as well.
They're not doing anything outside of the commons.
They are simply using their bodies by taking out the best of their ability.
So, it's really fair to <unk> in the way we do that, by sharing those <unk>
When people say, "You're a source of <unk> it says like a compliment.
And I know why it happens.
It's because of the lie, because they have sold this lie that disability makes us quite remarkable.
And honestly it doesn't do it.
And I know what you're thinking.
I'm here <unk> the inspiration, and you think, "My God, you're not going to be inspired by anything?"
And actually, I know I am.
<unk> of other people with disability at all time.
However, I don't know that I'm more lucky than them.
<unk> that this is a great idea to use <unk> <unk> to collect the things that they fall over.  <unk> the clever trick of how to charge the battery phone battery <unk>
Great.
We learn from the force and resistance of others, not against our bodies and our <unk> but against a world that we <unk> and <unk>
I really believe that that lie that they've been sold about disability is the biggest <unk>
It makes us hard life.
And that quote: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk> the reason that that is lie because it's not true -- because of the social model of disability.
A lot of smiles in a leg stretch hasn't done it never to become a <unk>
Never.
Nor do a lot of people in the middle of a bookstore and <unk> a positive attitude to turn all of those books to the <unk>
It's simply not going to happen.
I want to really live in a world where disability is not exception, but the norm.
I want to live where a 15 year-old girl sitting in his bedroom looking at <unk> the <unk> <unk> not considered <unk> of nothing to be on a chair.
I want to live in a world where we don't have so low expectations of the people with disability that we are going to take away from the bed and remember our names in the morning.
I want to live in a world where we value the genuine achievement of people with disabilities, and I want to live in a world where a 11 degree grade in school in Melbourne is not a little surprised that his new teacher is a <unk> <unk>
<unk> doesn't make us <unk> but question what you think to know about what you do.
Thank you.
What about augmented reality and professional football with <unk>
And what is the average speed of a <unk> <unk>
Unfortunately, today I'll just answer one of those questions, so please, not <unk>
When people think of reality, they think about <unk> <unk> and Tom <unk> <unk> the hands in the air, but the augmented reality is not science fiction.
<unk> reality is something that happens in our days and it will happen because we have the tools for it, and people need to know it, because the augmented reality will change our lives as much as the Internet and mobile phone.
So how did we get to reality <unk>
The first step, it's what I wear on Google <unk>
I'm sure many people are familiar with them.
What you might not know is that Google <unk> are a device that lets them see what I see.
They will allow you to experience what's going to be a professional <unk> in the field.
Right now, the only way to be in the field is that I try to <unk>
I have to use words.
I have to create a framework that you would engage with your imagination.
We can use Google Glass, underneath a hull and knowing what is running by the game of game to 160 <unk> the blood hitting the ears.
We can know that it feels like a man of 110 pounds -- we were trying to hold it up with all its self.
I've been there and I assure you that it's not nice.
So I had a few videos to show you what is using Google <unk> under the helmet, and give you a sense of that.
Unfortunately, it's not images of the practices of <unk> because the idea of the <unk> technology is a submarine going up to the surface. But we do what we can.
So let's see a video.
Chris <unk> Come on.
It's horrible to be <unk>
So a moment. <unk> a little bit.
<unk>
Go!
Chris <unk> As you can see, it's a <unk> of what's going to be <unk> in football field from the perspective of the <unk>
You may have realized that we need people, the rest of the team.
We have a video of them, <unk> from the University of Washington.
<unk> <unk> Mice <unk> pounds.
Blue 8, Blue <unk> Go!
Chris <unk> This is a little bit more to the feeling of being in the field, but it has nothing to be in the <unk>
<unk> want that experience.
<unk> want to be in the field, be their favorite players -- and have asked me on YouTube and <unk> <unk> you can see from the angle of a field <unk>
or a <unk>
We want to experience that."
Once we have that experience with <unk> and Google Glass, how we get into <unk> how do we take it to the next <unk>
We took it to that level using something called <unk> <unk> that you probably know a lot of it.
The Rift Lab has been described as the most realistic virtual reality apparatus ever created, and it's not <unk>
And I'm going to show you why, with this video.
Man: Oh, <unk>
No, no, no, no, I don't want to follow <unk> No!
Oh, my God! Ah!
<unk> That's the experience of a man on a Russian mountain, <unk> for his life.
What will be the experience of a fan when you put a video from Adrian <unk> across the line, <unk> from a <unk> with the arm before and make a <unk> What's the experience of a fan.
When it can be <unk> running by <unk> by releasing the ball into the bottom of the network? -- or <unk> making a <unk> in <unk>
What would be your experience when you go from a mountain to over 100 miles like a <unk> <unk>
Maybe the sales of <unk> for adults.
But this is not even <unk>
It's just virtual reality, <unk>
How do we get to achieve the reality <unk> <unk>
<unk> reality reality when the <unk> and the owners and the owners see the information that people want to see and think, "How do we use this to improve our <unk>
How do we use it to win <unk>
Because they always use technology to win.
They like to win. They give them money.
So, here's a quick deal of technology in the <unk>
In 1965, the Baltimore <unk> had a <unk> to his field <unk> to play faster.
They won the Super Bowl that year.
Other teams decided to <unk>
More people saw the party because it was more exciting, faster.
In 1994, the <unk> placed the <unk> on the <unk> of the field <unk> and after the <unk>
They had more <unk> because it was faster, more fun.
In <unk> imagine that they're a player coming back to your group and you see your next move that you have shown in front of you, in a plastic display that they carry on. You don't have to worry about forget a <unk>
It's because of the strategy.
They just go into the field and <unk>
And the coaches want it because if they don't follow their instructions, they lose them, they hate to lose games.
If you lose parties <unk> as a coach.
And they don't want that.
But augmented reality is not just a manual <unk>
<unk> reality is also a way to collect information and use it in real time to improve your way to play the game.
How would you do?
Well, a very simple option would be a camera in every corner corner of the stadium, having a view from the top of the people who are down.
You also get information from the <unk> and the <unk> something that is already working on.
And all that information is sent to your players.
Good teams will know <unk>
The bad guys will have information <unk>
This is going to be good for the good guys.
So your computer team will be as important as your <unk> and the data analysis will stop being in the way.
It's also going to be <unk> Who would have <unk>
How would it be in the country?
Imagine that it's the field <unk>
Let's get the ball and <unk>
We put a open receptor from a sudden, a <unk> on the left side of your bombsight -- you will tell you that a defense behind you are going to <unk> <unk> not <unk> but the <unk> system.
It's going to be <unk> by protection.
Another <unk> <unk> you have a open forest.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And the ball loses the trajectory.
You don't know where the receiver sees in their bombsight is an area of grass that lights and can change the race.
<unk> <unk> <unk> runs and <unk>
The <unk> and <unk> have followed the move from each angle.
This is something that will create massive emotion.
I'm going to make lots of people you see it, because people want to live that experience.
<unk> want to be in the ground.
They want to be your favorite player.
<unk> reality will be part of the sport because it's too profitable to not be.
But what I wonder is, we want this to be the only use of reality <unk>
We're going to use it as a bread and <unk> as our entertainment entertainment.
Because I think we can use it for something else.
I think we can use augmented reality to foster the empathy between human beings to show someone how literally, to be in the place of another person.
We know what this technology is worth <unk>
It generates billions of dollars a year.
But how much is this technology worth of a teacher in the classroom trying to show a <unk> how bad are their actions from the perspective of the <unk>
How much is this technology worth in Uganda or Russia trying to show the world how they live <unk>
How much is it also for a <unk> <unk> or Neil <unk> <unk> trying to inspire a generation of children to think more in space and science instead of <unk> and <unk>
Ladies and gentlemen, the augmented reality is coming.
The questions that we do, the decisions we take and the challenges that we face, <unk> as usual, of us.
Thank you.
I recently told me after 23 years of service in the <unk> <unk> of California.
Most of those 23 years ago, I was <unk> the southern tip of <unk> County, which includes the Golden Gate bridge.
The bridge is a <unk> structure, known to its beautiful views of San Francisco, the Pacific Ocean.
Unfortunately, it's also a magnet for suicide, being one of the most used places in the world.
The Golden Gate bridge was opened in <unk>
Joseph <unk> engineer engineer who build the bridge, said that, "The bridge is pretty much <unk>
<unk> from the bridge is not practical and <unk>
But from its openness, over 1,600 people have jumped to their death from that bridge.
Some people believe that traveling between the two towers will lead to another dimension, this bridge has been <unk> as such, such as it gets you from all of your concerns and pain, and the waters that go underneath <unk> your soul.
But let me tell you that it happens when the bridge is used to commit suicide.
After a free drop of four to five seconds, the body hits about 120 miles an hour.
The impact break out bone, some of which <unk> vital organs.
Most of them dies in impact.
The ones that don't normally fall into the water <unk> and then they <unk>
I don't think that the <unk> this method of suicide will be aware of the death of the death that would be <unk>
This is the wire.
Except about the two towers, there's 32 inches of parallel steel to the bridge.
This is where most people are in order to get before they get rid of life.
I can tell you for experience that once the person is on that edge, and in the most dark time, it's very difficult to bring it back.
I took this picture last year while this young man was talking to an officer looking at his life.
I want to tell you that we had success that day to bring it back on the <unk>
When I started working on the bridge, we didn't have any formal training.
<unk> to channel the way through these calls.
This was not just a bad service to those that we were born, the age of suicide, but the officers too.
We've come a long way since then.
Today, veterans and psychologists train the new government.
This is Jason <unk>
I met him the 22 de Julius last year to get a call from a <unk> subject sitting in the <unk> near the center.
<unk> and when I got there, I looked at Jason with a <unk> of the Golden Gate bridge.
Jason was only 32 years old, and he had flown up here from New Jersey.
In fact, there were flown up to two times before from New Jersey to try to kill them from this bridge.
After about an hour talking to <unk> we asked if we knew the story of the <unk> box.
<unk> the mythology <unk> <unk> created to <unk> and sent the Earth with a box, and he said, <unk> never open that <unk>
Well, one day, curiosity could more than <unk> and she opened the box.
She came out <unk> <unk> and all kinds of <unk> against the man.
The only good thing in the box was hope.
So Jason said, "What happens if you open the box and there's no <unk>
He stopped a <unk> leaned on the right, and it left.
This kind of smart kid in New Jersey had just taken my life.
I talked to the parents of Jason Jason that night, and I guess when I was talking to them, he didn't seem to be ringing very well, because the next day, the rabbi of the family called me to see what I was.
The parents of Jason is the <unk>
<unk> damage affects a lot of people.
I make you these questions: What would you do if a member of your family, a friend or someone loved them being <unk>
What about <unk>
Let's say that?
In my experience, we don't just have to talk, but you need to hear it.
To understand.
Not <unk> <unk> or say to the person you know how it feels like, because they probably won't.
They're just there, you can be the inflection point that they need.
If you think that someone is <unk> you don't fear <unk> and ask the question.
One way to ask the question is, <unk> in similar circumstances have thought about their life -- you've had these <unk>
<unk> the person in front of it can save life and be the inflection point for them.
Other signs to <unk> despair, believing things are terrible and that they never go to <unk> <unk> believing there is nothing that you can do to <unk> social isolation and a lost interest in life.
I came up with this talk just a couple of days, and I got an email from a lady and I'd like to read you your letter.
She lost his son at the 19 of this year, and he wrote this email just a couple of days ago, and it's with his permission and blessing I read it.
"Hi, <unk> I guess you're at the TED conference.
It must be a whole experience to be there.
I'm thinking that I should go to the bridge this weekend.
I just wanted to leave you a note.
I hope you can tell a lot of people and go home talking about it to their friends who tell their friends, and so on.
I'm still quite <unk> but noticing more moments of realizing that Mike won't go home.
Mike was driving from <unk> to San Francisco to see the party of 49 with his father the 19 of January.
It never came there.
I called the police of <unk> and the <unk> like disappeared that night.
The next morning, two officers came to my home and reported that the car of Mike was down on the bridge.
A witness had seen it jump from the bridge to the <unk> of the day before.
Thank you very much to fight for those who can be temporarily too weak to fight themselves.
Who hasn't been wrong with not having a real mental illness.
It must be so easy to end up with it.
My prayers are with you for your fight.
The <unk> the Golden Gate Bridge is supposed to be a passage through our beautiful bay, not a <unk>
Good luck this week, <unk>
I can't imagine the value that she needed to go to the bridge and walk the way his son took that day, and also the value to go forward.
I'd like to introduce you to a man who I mean with hope and value.
On March 11, 2005, I wrote a radio call for a <unk> subject on the front sidewalk near the northern tower.
I was walking down the sidewalk and looked at this man, Kevin <unk> standing on the sidewalk.
When he saw me, he crossed the <unk> and stopped at that little tube that goes around the tower.
Over the time and the next half of the next time, I heard as Kevin talked about his depression and despair.
Kevin decided to account that day come back on that lane and give life another opportunity.
When Kevin came back, I was <unk>
"This is a new beginning, a new life."
But I asked him, "What was it that he did <unk> and gave the hope and the life of another <unk>
And you know what she told me?
He said, "I was <unk>
He stopped talking and just <unk>
Shortly after that incident, I got a letter from Kevin, and I have that letter with me, and I would like to <unk>
"Dear Mr. <unk> nothing erase the 11th events and you're one of the reasons that Kevin continues with us.
Honestly, I think Kevin was <unk> for help.
It's been diagnosed with a mental illness for which it's been properly <unk>
<unk> to Kevin when I only had six months, completely unconscious of all those traits -- but thank God, we now know it.
Kevin is in order, as it said.
We thank God for you.
I really have to debt with you, <unk> <unk>
And at the end, she wrote <unk> When I visited the General General in San Francisco that night, you <unk> like the patient.
<unk> I did have to <unk>
Now, Kevin is a <unk> father and a active member of society.
It speaks openly about the events that day and their depression with hope that their story will inspire others.
<unk> is not just something that I've found in the work.
It's personal.
My grandfather is <unk> with poison.
That act, despite finishing your own pain, stealing the opportunity to meet him.
This is what suicide.
For most people who are <unk> or those who consider the age of suicide would not think of hurt another person.
They just want your own <unk>
And usually this is achieved by three things: to sleep, drugs or alcohol or death.
In my career, I've responded and I've been involved in hundreds of mental illness and suicide calls around the bridge.
From those incidents that I've been directly involved, I've only lost two, but those two are too much.
One was <unk>
The other one was a man who told him about an hour.
During that time, I was sending his hand at three times.
On the end, he looked at me, and he said, <unk> I'm sorry, but I have to go."
And <unk>
<unk> absolutely awful.
I want to tell you, though, that the vast majority of the people that we get to contact with that bridge is not <unk>
In addition, those few who have jumped from the bridge and lived and they can talk about it, that one percent or two percent, most of those people have said that the second one that they leave on the side, the railing realized they had made a mistake and they wanted to live.
I tell people, the bridge doesn't only connect to <unk> with San Francisco, but also the people.
That connection, or bridge that we do, is something that everyone and each of us should be able to be able to do.
suicide is <unk>
There's help.
Thank you very much.
The world makes you be what you don't are, but in your interior you know what you are, and a question: How do you focus on that?
I have to be something only in that sense, but I'm not alone in any way I am alone.
When I became a model I felt that there was the dream that I had had since a child.
My outside was finally influenced by my inner truth with my inner self.
So for complicated reasons, I'm going to go over later, when I look at this photo, I think, <unk> <unk> <unk>
But last October, I discovered that <unk> I'm beginning to see.
We will all give us our families, our religion, our society, our moment in history, even our bodies.
Some of them have the value of <unk> to get rid of the <unk> imposed by the color of the skin or the beliefs of those around us.
They are people who always defy the status quo, which is considered <unk>
In my case, the last nine years, many of my neighbors -- a lot of my friends, my agent even, ignored my story.
I think this enigma is called <unk>
This is mine.
I was assigned to the <unk> because of the appearance of my <unk>
I remember my five years in the Philippines, in my house, I was always wearing this shirt in my head.
And my mom wondered, "Why are you always wearing that t-shirt on the <unk>
I said, "Mom, it's my hair -- I'm a <unk>
I knew then how to <unk>
The gender has always been considered to be <unk> but now we know that, actually, it's a more complex and mystery thing.
Because of my success, I never helped me to share my story, not because I thought it's a bad thing, but because of how the world is about those of us who want to <unk>
Every day I appreciate being female.
I have Mom, Dad and a family who embrace me as I am.
Many aren't so lucky.
There's a long tradition in the <unk> culture that celebrates the mystery of gender.
There's a Buddhist goddess of compassion.
There's a <unk> goddess of the <unk>
And when I was eight years old, I was at a party in the Philippines who celebrated these puzzles.
I was in front of the stage and I remember that this beautiful woman appeared in front of me, and I remember that moment as if something <unk> This is the kind of woman I would like to be.
And when I was 15 years old, when I was still wearing man, I met this woman named <unk>
This is the director of a gay beauty competition.
That night she asked me, "Why haven't you been involved in the <unk> competition.
He told me that if she <unk> she was responsible for <unk> <unk> and <unk> and that night, I won in the bathroom, I won in <unk> and he was third <unk> among over 40 candidates.
That moment changed my life.
Suddenly, I was inside the world of beauty.
Not a lot of people can say that their first work was from beauty of beauty of women, <unk> but I can.
I also met the <unk> goddess especially when they went to the remote provinces of the Philippines.
But more importantly, I met my best friends in that community.
In 2001, my mom had moved to San Francisco, he called me and told me that he passed my entry on the green card that I could go to live in the U.S.
I was shocked.
I said to my mother, "Mommy, I'm <unk>
I'm here with friends, I like to travel and be a queen of <unk>
But then, two weeks later, he called me and said, "You know what if you <unk> the U.S. you can change the name and the identity of <unk>
It was all I needed to hear.
My mom suggested that I was two <unk> to my name.
She also accompanied me in Thailand to the 19 years.
It's curious that in some of the most rural cities in Thailand do the most <unk> surgeries and secure.
At that time, in the United States, it was necessary to do surgery before we changed the name and the gender.
So in 2001 I went to San Francisco, and I remember looking at the car license with the name of <unk> and <unk> of gender <unk>
It was a great moment.
For some people, your identity document means being able to drive or be able to get a <unk> but for me it was the license to live, to feel <unk>
Suddenly, my fears saw <unk>
I felt I could conquer my dream and move to New York, and it will be model.
Many aren't so lucky.
I think of this woman in <unk> <unk> <unk>
A young woman in New York who was born, who was living his truth, but he said, <unk> put his life.
For many of my community, that's the reality that they live.
Our suicide rates are eight times higher than the rest of the population.
All 20 November, we do a global <unk> for the <unk> Day.
I am on this stage, because of a long history of people that were <unk> and stood in front of injustice.
These are Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia <unk>
Today, right now, I'm coming out of the closet.
I can't keep living my truth and just for me.
I want to do the best to help others live their truth without shame, not fear.
I'm here, <unk> so that someday there's no more than 20 of <unk>
My deepest truth led me to accept what I am.
Do you?
Thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.  <unk> <unk> <unk> a quick question.
<unk> <unk> Right. <unk> <unk> I thank all of my <unk>
To my support network, my parents especially, to my family, who is very strong.
I remember all the time I've been to young women who were young people who have <unk> and some times, when they were called me and told me that their parents couldn't accept it, I took my mom and she said, "Mommy, can you call this <unk>
Sometimes it works. It's not just gender identity, that's what is in the center of what we are, right?
I mean, everybody was assigned to a gender at birth, and what I'm trying to do is put on the table with the theme that sometimes that task will not block, and that there should be a space that would allow people to <unk> and this is a conversation that we should have with parents, with colleagues.
<unk> movement is <unk> compared to the gay movement.
There's still a lot of work to do.
There should be understanding.
There should be space for curiosity and to ask questions, and I hope that all of you are my allies.
KS: Thank you. All right. <unk> Thank you.
In many <unk> societies and tribal societies are generally known to their children, but I'm one of the few parents who is known for her daughter, and I'm proud of it.
<unk> started his campaign by defending their rights in 2007. And when their efforts were <unk> in 2011, the <unk> <unk> <unk> became very <unk> a very popular girl in his country.
Before that, I was my daughter, but now I'm his dad.
Ladies and gentlemen, if we take a look at the history of humanity, the story of women is the story of the <unk> of inequality, of violence and exploitation.
You see, in <unk> societies just from the beginning, when when I was born a girl, her birth was not <unk>
It's not coincidentally, or his father or their mother.
The neighborhood comes out, gives her <unk> to mother and nobody <unk> the father.
And a mother got a lot of mother to have a child.
When it comes to the first child, the first daughter, gets sad.
When he gives birth to the second daughter, <unk> and, with the hope of a son, when he <unk> his third daughter, feels guilty like a criminal.
Not only the mother suffering, but the daughter, <unk> daughter, when it grows, he suffers as well.
At age five years old, when I should go to school, it stays home and a school person to her brothers.
Until the age of 12 years, in a way, has a good life.
You can <unk>
It can play with your friends on the street, and it can move through the streets as a butterfly.
But when you go into your adolescence, when I was 13 years old, you have to get out of her house without a male <unk>
It's confined to the four walls of their house.
It's not a free person.
It becomes the honor of her father and her brothers and her brothers and her brothers and her family, and if you were able to get the code of that of an honor -- the could even kill.
And it's interesting that this source of honor, not only affects the life of a <unk> also affects the life of male members of the family.
So this brother, <unk> the joys of her life and the happiness happiness in the name of the honor.
And there's one more rule of <unk> societies called <unk>
A good girl is supposed to be very <unk> very humble and very <unk>
It's the judgment.
The model of a good girl must be <unk>
It's supposed to be silent and that accepts people's decisions and their mother and people's decisions and even if you don't want to.
If you put it up with a man who doesn't like or if you will, with an old man, he has to <unk> because it doesn't want to be <unk> of <unk>
If you get it very young, it has to accept it.
Otherwise, the <unk> <unk>
And what happens to the end?
In words of a <unk> "The <unk> <unk> and then gives birth to more children and <unk>
And the irony of the situation is that this mother, <unk> the same lesson of <unk> to his daughter and the same lesson of honor to his children.
And this vicious cycle continues and it continues.
<unk> brothers and sisters, when I was born <unk> and for the first time, believe me, I don't like the newborns, to be honest, but when I was there, and I looked at her eyes, I was extremely <unk>
And a lot before I was <unk> I thought about her name, and I was fascinated with a <unk> <unk> of the freedom in Afghanistan.
His name was <unk> of <unk> and I called my daughter for her.
But when I was asked -- they were all men, and I grabbed my pen, and I was <unk> a line of my name, and I wrote, <unk>
And when she took it on, when I was four and a half years old, I was <unk> in my school.
You might be wondering why I have to mention a little girl standing in a school?
Yes, I have to <unk>
They can take it for granted in Canada, in the United States, in many developed countries, but in the poor countries, in tribal societies, in tribal societies, it's a great event for the life of a child.
<unk> in a school means the recognition of his identity and his name.
One thing to school means that it's entered the world of dreams and the aspirations where it can explore their potential for future life.
I have five sisters, and none of them could go to school, and they would be <unk> two weeks earlier, when he <unk> the <unk> form of <unk> and was in the relative to the family, I couldn't remember the <unk> of some of my sisters.
And the reason was that I had never seen the names of my sisters writing in any document.
That was the reason for my daughter.
What my father couldn't give my sisters or her daughters, I thought I had to change it.
I used to appreciate the intelligence and the <unk> of my daughter.
<unk> to sit with me when my friends came to me.
The encouraged to go with me to different meetings.
And all of these values, I've tried <unk> in their personality.
And this was not just for her, just to <unk>
I've got all of these good values in my school for girls and girls and boys for the way.
I used education for <unk>
<unk> my daughters, taught students to forget the lesson of the <unk>
I taught students to forget the lesson called <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, raised for more rights for women, and they were able to have more and more space for women in society.
But we found a new phenomenon.
It was lethal for human rights, and in particular, for women's rights.
He was called <unk>
That means a complete denial of engaging women in all of political, economic and social activities.
Hundreds of schools were lost.
The girls were banned to go to school.
Women were forced to use <unk> and they stopped going to the markets.
The musicians were <unk> <unk> girls and the singers was killed.
<unk> millions, but a few <unk> and it was terrifying to have around those people who kill and <unk> when you talk about their rights.
It's really frightening.
At the age of 10 years, <unk> got up and got up in the right to education.
He wrote a newspaper for the blog blog of the BBC, was offered her same for the documentaries of the New York Times, and I spoke on every platform he could.
And his voice was the most powerful voice.
It <unk> like a <unk> around the world.
And that was the reason why the Taliban couldn't tolerate their campaign and the nine in October 2012, was fired to <unk> in the head.
It was a <unk> day for my family and me.
The world became a great black hole.
Whereas my daughter was <unk> between life and death, I would tell my wife -- "I've got <unk> for what happened to my daughter, <unk>
And <unk> said, "Please, don't you <unk>
<unk> the fair cause.
<unk> your life in play by the cause of peace, by the cause of peace, and by the cause of education, and your daughter was inspired by you and you were <unk>
They were both in the right path and God <unk>
These few words would be a lot for me, and I didn't go back to ask again.
When I was <unk> I was in the hospital and he had severe migraine headaches because his facial nerve was cut down, I used to see a dark shadow that would be held by the face of my wife.
But my daughter is never <unk>
I used to say, "I'm okay with my <unk> <unk> and with the <unk> in my face.
I'm going to get right. Please don't <unk>
It was a comfort for us, and we were <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, we've learned from her how to resist the hardest moments and I'm pleased to share with you that despite being an icon for women's rights and women, it's like any 12-year-old girl.
<unk> when he didn't end his job.
You fight your siblings, and I'm very happy for that.
People ask me, "What about my <unk> that has made as bold to <unk> as brave and expressive and <unk>
I say, don't ask me what I did.
<unk> what I didn't do.
I didn't cut your wings out and that's it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
I was <unk> of the brain 18 years ago, and since that day, the science of the brain has become a personal passion.
I'm engineering.
And I want to tell you that recently I've joined the group of Google, where I've had a <unk> to my <unk> the Google visualization -- but all the work that I'm talking about here today about the science of the brain, I did before I join Google or outside my work there.
Having said this, there is a stigma when you hit a brain operation.
Are you just just as smart or not?
It's not going to be like this, you'll be <unk>
After the <unk> I was missing a part of the brain, and I had to live with it.
It wasn't the gray matter, but it was the dead part of the center that creates important hormones and <unk>
Immediately after the operation, I had to decide how much to take, from more than a dozen chemical powerful chemicals every day, because if I didn't take anything, they would die in a few hours.
Every day, for the last 18 years, I've had to decide about combinations of combinations of chemicals, and try to figure out to stay alive.
More than I've been saved by it.
But luckily, I have a soul of <unk> for what I decided to try and get the dose of <unk> because it really doesn't exist a clear map to say it in <unk>
I began to test with different mixes and I was shocked to see how small changes in the dose of <unk> dramatically my sense of who I was, my way to think, my behavior with others.
A particularly <unk> case for a few months, I gave doses and typical chemicals for a man in Egypt, and I was surprised to see how to <unk> my thoughts.
I was always thinking, I thought all the time in sex, and I believed that it was the smartest person around the world, and --  -- of course, many times in the past I've met several guys like this, or maybe some versions of <unk>
It turned out as an extreme.
But my great surprise was that I wasn't trying to be <unk>
In fact, I was <unk> a little bit of <unk> fixing a problem that had on the front, and it just didn't look like this.
So I couldn't deal with it.
It changed my <unk>
But I think that experience gave me a new appreciation of men and about what they have to do -- I've been better at men.
What I was trying to do is we adjust those hormones and neurotransmitters and so on, it was to recover my intelligence after the disease and <unk> my creative thought, my flow of ideas.
<unk> thinking almost always in images, and that became my point of reference reference -- how to make those mental images that I use to create <unk> my ideas, if you were <unk> <unk> new ideas and <unk> situations.
This kind of thoughts is not new.
<unk> like <unk> Descartes and <unk> look at things like this.
They thought that the images and the mental ideas were the same thing.
Today there is those who challenge this idea, and there are a lot of discussions about how the minds works, for me is simple: for most of us, the mental images are fundamental to the <unk> thinking and <unk>
So, after several years, I was able to find the right point and I have a lot of great mental <unk> and they really do very sophisticated mental <unk>
Now, I'm working on how to take these physical images of my mind to the computer screen.
Can you imagine what would happen if a movie director would be able to use their imagination only to direct the world that has the <unk>
Or if a musician could extract the music of her head?
There are amazing possibilities with this, as the way people creative can get to share the speed of light.
And the truth is, the only difficulty doing this is simply to increase the resolution of our brain scanning systems.
Let me show you why I think we're pretty close to get to this with two recent experiments that did have done by two groups in neuroscience.
They both used MRI technology, functional fMRI -- to represent the brain here, and you can see the brain scan done by <unk> <unk> and his colleagues at Harvard.
The column on the left shows the scan of a person who looks at an image.
The column in the middle shows the scanning of the brain of that same individual as you were looking at that same image.
The column on the right was created <unk> the content of the central column on the left.
This is repeated in many different individuals with many different images, always with a similar outcome.
The difference between looking at a picture and imagine to see that same image.
Now, let me share with you another experiment. This is from the <unk> <unk> lab in Berkeley, California.
They managed to turn the brain waves into visual fields.
Let's put it in this way.
In this experiment, he showed the people hundreds of hours of YouTube videos while they were getting their brains to create a great pool of reactions of the brain to the footage video.
And then I showed you a film with new, new people, new animals, and as long as you get a new <unk>
The computer, using only the brain data on the scan of the <unk> to show what it seemed like the person was seeing.
On the right you can see the <unk> of the computer, and on the left, the video that I showed you.
This blew us up.
We're well close to doing it.
We just need to improve resolution.
And now, remember, when you look at an image and when you imagine that same image, you create in the brain the same <unk>
This took place with the brain scanning brain systems available today, and its resolution increased as a thousand times in the last few years.
Now we need to increase resolution with a thousand times more to get a deeper look.
How would you do that?
There are many techniques to do it.
One is opening the skull and get rid of electrodes.
I don't offer myself for that.
A lot of people are proposing new techniques of projection for images, even I think, with the recent outcome of the MRI -- first we need to ask the next one, this technology will be the end of the <unk>
The conventional wisdom says that the only way to get bigger resolution is with larger magnets -- but at this point, magnets more <unk> only provide little improvements in the resolution, not gains by thousands of us as we need.
I propose this idea: instead of larger magnets -- let's make better live?"
We can create much more complex structures with slightly different arrangements -- like making a <unk>
And why does this matter?
In the last few years, a lot of effort in the MRI were to make some really big magnets -- right?
However, most of the recent advances in <unk> of clever and bright solutions on coding and <unk> in the <unk> and <unk> <unk> in the MRI system.
At the same time, instead of a magnetic field, they would get <unk> magnetic patterns to the frequencies of radio <unk>
So when we combine the magnetic patterns with the patterns of the radio frequencies of radio radio <unk> we can increase in a massive form of information that you can get in a single <unk>
In addition, we can divide into layers of our growing knowledge of the brain structure and the memory to create the increase in the thousands that we need.
By using the <unk> we should be able to measure not only the waste of blood fluid but the <unk> hormones that I mentioned and perhaps even neural activity. This is sleep.
Will we be able to put our ideas in direct in direct media.
Can you imagine if we could go over the language and communicate directly through the <unk>
What would we be <unk>
And how do we learn to deal with the truths of human thinking without <unk>
You thought the Internet is a big thing.
These are great questions.
It would be <unk> use as a tool to amplify our skills of thinking and communication.
Certainly, this same tool could lead to the cure for Alzheimer's and similar diseases.
We have a few more choices to open up this door.
Anyway, they choose a year to happen in five or 15 years?
It's hard to imagine that it will take a lot more.
We need to learn how to give this step together.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you tonight about getting out of the closet, and not in a traditional sense, not just the gay self.
I think we all have <unk>
Your closet may be telling some person for the first time that love or say to someone who's pregnant, or say to someone who has cancer, or any kind of hard conversation that you have to do in life.
And I all closet is a difficult conversation and even though our issues can vary <unk> the experience of I've lived and out of that closet is universal.
It's fear, and we don't like it, and it must happen.
A lot of years ago, I was working in the South Side <unk> <unk> a restaurant in the city, and being there, I had to go through several phases of the intensity of <unk> <unk> not <unk> my armpits, <unk> the letters of <unk> giving <unk> as a <unk>
And I'm going to be the slope of my pants <unk> and I had <unk> my head -- I was doing a little bit, I would usually ask you a little kid, "Hey, you're a kid or a <unk>
And it would appear in the table.
I had my jaw a little bit more, I would take my coffee with a leave with a <unk>
The father <unk> <unk> the newspaper and mother launched a cold look at his son.
But I would never say anything, and <unk> out of it.
And I got to the point that every time I went to a place where there was a child between three and 10 years, I was ready to fight.
And that's a terrible feeling.
So I promised me that the next time I would say something.
It should be that hard conversation.
So after a few weeks, it happened again.
"You're a kid or a <unk>
A family silence, but this time I was prepared -- and I was about to get into the female issues at the table.  I had the quotes from Betty <unk>
<unk> <unk>
Even a piece of the "Vagina Monologues" I <unk>
And so I took it down and I went down the look at my back and my back four years with a little pink girl, staring at what it's not a challenge for a <unk> <unk> just a girl with a question: "You're a kid or a <unk>
And so I took it back again, I stood up with it close to her, and I said, "Hey, I know this is something complicated.
I have the short hair like a boy, and I saw a boy, but I'm a girl, and I'm a girl, and you know, like you like to use a pink, and sometimes you like to use a comfortable pajamas.
Now, I'm more of the kind of girl in a <unk> guy.
And that girl looked at me <unk> paying attention, and he said, "My favorite pajamas is <unk> and he has a fish.
You can give me a <unk> for <unk>
And that was it. They just "Ah, OK. You're a girl.
What about <unk> <unk>
It was the easy conversation that I ever ever had.
And by <unk> because the girl in the <unk> and I, both were <unk> one with the other.
So as many of us, I've lived in some <unk> in my life, and yes, my walls used to be a <unk>
But inside, in the dark, you can't know what color are the walls.
You just know how a feels living in a closet.
It's like my closet is not different from yours or yours or yours.
<unk> will give you a hundred reasons why coming out of my closet was more difficult to go out of his, but this is the <unk> It's hard not to be <unk>
The hard thing is hard.
Who can tell me to explain to someone who have declared in banking <unk> it's more difficult than saying it has been <unk>
Who can tell me that this story that I tell you that this story is more difficult to tell your child five years that you're going to <unk>
There's no more difficult thing -- there's only the hard thing.
We need to stop classifying what it is difficult to be very hard about what hard to make us feel better for another person to make us feel better or worse in relation to our <unk> and we must only feel empathy because we all live something hard.
At some point in our lives, we all live in <unk> and they can make them feel security, or at least more security than the other side of the door.
But I'm here to tell you that no matter what your walls, a closet is not a place to live in.
Thank you.  Imagine yourself 20 years ago.
I, who had a horse tail, a dress and <unk> shoes.
He was not militant gay, to fight for any child for four years to get to coffee.
I was frozen because I was in a corner of my dark closet <unk> my <unk> <unk> and the moving only muscle is the most scary thing I've ever done.
My family, my whole friends, strangers who I've spent my entire life trying to deal with it, and now the world would turn around purpose.
I was burning the pages of a script that we all have followed for so long, but if you don't start that <unk> you will kill.
One of my most memorable C-section was in my sister.
It was the first time that many guests knew that I was gay, and when I was doing my <unk> lady from honor, in my black dress and <unk> I walked around the tables and finally came up with one where my parents were in my parents, people who knew I was doing years.
And after talking about a moment, one of the women shouted, <unk> to Nathan <unk>
And the battle of the gay story had begun.
<unk> once you were in the <unk>
"Well, yeah, the truth is that we have friends in St. <unk>
"Well, we've never been there, but we've heard it's <unk>
<unk> You know my <unk> <unk>
It's very good and never talked about having <unk>
<unk> What is your favorite TV show.
Our dream Will and Grace Will and Grace <unk>
And you know who <unk> <unk>
Jack is our <unk>
And then a woman, <unk> but instead of trying to try his support, to get me to know that I was on my side, finally said, "Well, sometimes my husband uses a <unk>
And I had an opportunity at that moment, as you have all the <unk> <unk>
<unk> could have been easy to indicate where they felt <unk>
It's not very hard to find them and realize the fact that they were <unk>
And what else can you ask for somebody, but you can do it.
If you're going to be authentic with somebody, you have to be prepared for the authentic thing that you could do.
That's how hard conversations remain without being my strong point.
Ask anyone with the ones I have <unk>
But I'm getting better, and I follow what I like to call the three principles of <unk>
Now, please see this through the gay perspective, but you understand that what it involves coming out of any closet is essentially the same.
Number one: Be real.
<unk> the <unk> Be you.
That girl in coffee didn't have <unk> but I was ready for battle.
If you want someone to be <unk> the others must know that we also suffer.
Number two: Be <unk> Just <unk> <unk> <unk>
If you know you're gay, <unk>
If they say to their parents that maybe they could be gay, they will maintain the hope that that could change.
Don't give them a false sense of hope.
And number three, and more important --  Let me the complex.
You communicate their truth.
It would never be done by that.
And some of them can be injured -- they can be injured -- so they have done, but I'm never sorry for what they are.
And yes, maybe some of you may feel <unk> but that's something in them.
Those are the expectations of them about what you are, but not your own.
That's the story of them, but not of you.
The only story that matters is that you want to write.
So the next time you find in a dark way, <unk> a <unk> must know that we've all been there before.
And you may feel very yourself, but they're not.
Thank you, <unk> Enjoy the <unk>
<unk> what is that?
So if you look at the story of how the intelligence has been seen -- a productive example has been the famous quote by <unk> <unk> that "The question of whether a machine can think is interesting as the question of whether a submarine can <unk>
When <unk> <unk> wrote this as a criticism of computer pioneers like Alan <unk>
And so a few years ago, I would have a program to try to understand the fundamental physical mechanisms underlying intelligence.
Go back a step.
We first start with a mental experiment.
Imagine that you're from an alien race that you don't know anything about the biology of Earth or the intelligence of the Earth, but they have incredible telescopes, and you can look at the Earth, and they have incredibly long lives, so you can see the Earth for millions, even billions of years.
And you see a very strange effect.
Of course, as <unk> we know that the reason is that we're trying to save ourselves.
We're trying to avoid an impact.
But if you're from a alien race that doesn't know anything about the intelligence of the Earth, which has no idea about the intelligence of the Earth, it would be forced to develop a physical theory that explains how, until a certain time in time, the asteroids that are going to build up the surface of a planet -- they will stop doing it.
And so I claim this is the same question that we can understand the physical nature of intelligence.
So in this program that led to several years ago, I studied a variety of topics through science, through various disciplines, that <unk> I think, to a single underlying mechanism of intelligence.
In <unk> for example, there has been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be bombarded to the development of intelligence, and in particular, for the development of universal states that we will have the diversity of possible future <unk>
Finally, in the management of robotic movement, there's been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to harness the skills of robots to maximize the future freedom of action with the order of doing complex tasks.
And so, taking all of these different themes and <unk> together, I said, for a number of years ago, there's a mechanism underlying the intelligence that we can extract from all these different <unk>
There's only one equation for <unk>
And I think the answer is yes. What you're seeing is probably the closest equivalent of an E = <unk> for the intelligence I've ever seen.
So what you're looking at here is a claim that intelligence is a energy force, which acts in order to maximize future freedom of action.
It acts to maximize the future freedom of action, or maintain the open choices with a force of the future of possible future accessible, yes, to an imminent time, <unk>
In a few words, intelligence doesn't like to be <unk>
The intelligence is trying to maximize the future freedom of action and maintain the alternative choices.
And so, having in mind this equation, it's natural to ask: What can you do with this?
How <unk> is it?
<unk> the level of human intelligence.
<unk> intelligence.
So I'm going to show you now a video that I think, I'll show some of the amazing applications of this simple equation.
Narrator: <unk> research in cosmology have suggested that universes that produce more mess, or <unk> during their life should have trend more favorable conditions for the existence of intelligent beings like us.
But what if that <unk> connection between entropy and intelligence -- a more <unk> relationship.
What happens if intelligent behavior is not only correlated with the production of entropy in the long term, but actually it comes out of it?
To find out, we've developed a software engine called <unk> designed to maximize the production of the long-term entropy in any system where you can find it.
<unk> <unk> could pass multiple animal intelligence, play games of human intelligence, and they even make money out of them, actions, all of that without being told to do that.
Here are some examples of <unk> in action.
Just like a human foot without <unk> here we see <unk> <unk> automatically a pole using a <unk>
This behavior is remarkable partly because we never gave him a goal.
He just decided to be able to balance the <unk>
This ability to balance it will have applications for human robotics and human assistance technologies.
This ability to use tools will have applications in smart manufacturing and agriculture.
In addition, just like some other animals can cooperate pulling up the opposite side of a rope at the same time to release the food, here we see that <unk> can do a version of the model of that task.
This ability to cooperation has interesting implications for economic planning and in a variety of other fields.
<unk> is widely applicable in a variety of <unk>
For example, here we see them successfully playing a game of <unk> against itself, <unk> their potential for play.
So here we see <unk> orchestrate new connections into a social network where the friends are constantly getting together, and keeps the net right together.
This same power power capacity also has apps in health care, energy and intelligence.
So here we see <unk> organizing the routes of a fleet of boats, discovering it successfully and using the Panama Canal to extend the global level of Panama to the Pacific.
In the same way, <unk> is widely applicable in defense and logistics and transportation.
Finally, here we see <unk> spontaneously discover and running a strategy of <unk> <unk> in a simulated series of <unk> <unk> successfully increasing the assets under their exponentially.
This risk of risk risk will have vast applications in finance and secure.
Alex <unk> What you've seen is that a variety of brands of human human behaviors such as the use of tools, walking upright and social cooperation. They all derive from one equation that leads to a system to maximize its future freedom of action.
Now, here's a deep <unk> here.
Let's go back to the beginning of the term <unk> <unk> <unk> there was always the concept that if we had smart machines, it would have a <unk> rebellion of it.
The machines will become <unk> against us.
One of the biggest consequences of this work is that maybe all of these decades, we've had all the concept of rebellion -- <unk> in reverse.
It's not that machines first become smart and then <unk> and trying to take over the world.
It's all opposite, that the urge to take the control of all future is a more fundamental principle than the intelligence of intelligence, that general intelligence can actually arise out directly from taking control, instead of being backwards.
Another important consequence is the search for the target.
They often ask me, how do you look for goals to learn from this kind of <unk>
My equivalent to that statement will happen to the descendants of them to help them build artificial artificial intelligence or help them to understand human intelligence, the following: The intelligence must be viewed as a physical process that tries to maximize the future freedom of action and avoid restrictions in their own future.
Thank you very much.
We're at an inflection point in human history, something between the <unk> of stars and losing the planet that we call <unk>
Although, in the last few years, we've expanded a huge amount of knowledge of how our Earth fits in the context of the universe.
The Kepler NASA mission has discovered thousands of possible planets orbiting other stars, which points out to the Earth is only one between the billions of planets in our galaxy.
Kepler is a space telescope, which measures the faint <unk> of the stars when the planets go ahead of them and blocking a little bit of that light that you go.
The data gathered by Kepler shows the sizes of planets besides the distance between them and their mother star.
So together, this helps us understand if these planets are small and <unk> like the Earth planets in our solar system, and also the amount of light that gets from their self.
At the same time, this gives clues about whether these planets we find are habitable or not.
Unfortunately, while we're finding this trove of potentially altered worlds -- our own planet is <unk> under the weight of humanity.
The year 2014 was the hottest recorded.
<unk> and sea ice that have been with us from us now now are disappearing in a matter of decades.
These environmental changes that we have caused on a global scale have now <unk> our ability to alter the course.
But I'm not a weather scientist in the weather, no <unk>
But I study the <unk> of the planet influenced by the stars, with the hope of finding places in the universe where to discover life beyond our planet.
So I could say I'm looking for alien opportunities in the property sector.
Now, as someone very interested in the pursuit of life in the universe I can tell you that the more I look for planets similar to the Earth, most of our own planet.
Each of these new worlds invites a comparison between the newly discovered and the planets that we know better -- the ones that we know from our solar system.
Let's take our neighbor, Mars.
Mars is small and <unk> and despite being a little bit further from the Sun, it can be considered a potentially livable world demonstrated this for a mission like the Kepler <unk>
In fact, it's possible that Mars has been habitable in the past and part of it that we study so much to Mars.
Our <unk> like <unk> tracks its surface into search of clues about the origins of life as we know it.
The satellites that <unk> them as the <unk> mission take samples from the atmosphere and they try to understand how Mars has been able to lose their <unk>
Business companies now offer not just short space flights but also the possibility of living on Mars.
But even though all of these images, <unk> remind us to the deserts of our planet, places that are linked in our imagination with ideas and <unk> and <unk> compared to the Earth, Mars is a pretty terrible place to live in.
Let's take the extension of the <unk> areas of our planet that are still going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
Even in the <unk> and <unk> places on the Earth, the air is fresh and full of oxygen <unk> by our tropical forests at thousands of miles away.
I worry that this excitement for the colonization, of Mars and other planets at the bottom of Mars and other planets that are going to be very sad and the belief and the belief of some that Mars is going to expect there to save this <unk> <unk> of the only planet that we know that's truly livable Earth.
For a lot that I like to think about exploration -- I'm deep in deep with this idea.
There are a lot of good reasons to go to Mars, but to say that Mars is going to be there for humanity is like imagine that the captain of the Titanic will tell us that the party of the truth will have a place later on the <unk>    Thank you.
But the goals for <unk> exploration and the Earth preservation is not <unk>
No, they are actually faces of the same <unk> the goal to understand, to preserve and improve life in the future.
The extreme environments present in our world look like <unk> aliens.
Only you find closer to home.
If we can understand how to create and keep <unk> spaces, in the hostile and land areas of the ground, maybe we can meet the need to preserve our environment and go beyond that.
I leave you with a <unk> experiment.
A lot of years ago, physicist Fermi asked myself, having to realize that our universe has been around for a long time, and we hope that there was a lot of planets in this universe, we should have found evidence of the life of alien life to now.
Well, where are they?
Well, one possible solution to the paradox is that when civilizations become advanced advanced enough to consider to continue to live between the stars, they lose the notion of how important it is to protect the origin of the planets that we're going back.
It's arrogant to think that only colonization, <unk> will save us from ourselves, but the planetary preservation and the <unk> exploration.
If we really believe in our ability to engage the hostile environments to the human presence, then we should be able to overcome the task even easier to preserve the <unk> on Earth.
Thank you.
A few years ago, I took my own home.
And while I was on the front porch looking at my pockets, I realized I didn't have the keys.
In fact, I could see the window in the dining table, where there were <unk>
So quickly I tried to open all the other doors and windows, and they were all pretty closed.
I thought I would call a <unk> at least had my cell phone, but at midnight, a <unk> could take a long time to get it, and it was cold.
I could not go back home from my friend of Jeff to pass night because I had a early flight to Europe in the next morning, and I was looking at my passport and my bag.
<unk> expensive, but sure that no more expensive than a <unk> at night, so I thought, despite the circumstances, I'd come right out there.
I'm a <unk> and I know a little bit about how the brain works.
<unk> <unk> that increases heart rate -- <unk> levels of adrenaline and <unk> the thought.
And when I came to the counter <unk> in the airport, I realized I didn't have my passport.
Well, I had a lot of time to think about those eight hours without sleep.
And I started to ask myself, if there was something that could be done, systems that could put in their place, that I would say that was going to happen bad things.
Or at least, if you look at bad things, you will get the probability that it is a complete catastrophe thing.
So I got to think about that, but until one month later, my thoughts don't <unk>
I was having dinner with my colleague Danny <unk> the Nobel Prize, and a little embarrassed I told him about that I broke the window, and I had forgotten my passport, and Danny shared with me who had been practicing something called <unk> <unk>
It's something that he had learned from the psychologist Gary <unk> who had written about this a few years earlier, known as the <unk>
Everybody knows what's <unk>
Every time there's a disaster, a team of experts come and try to figure out what went wrong, right?
In <unk> as explains <unk> you look forward and try to figure out all the things that you could go wrong, then it tries to figure out what it can do to prevent things that were going or to minimize the damage.
So what I want to talk to you about is a few things that we can do in the shape of a <unk>
Some of them are <unk> they're not so evident.
I'm going to start with the obvious ones.
At the house, you will find a place for things that are very easily.
This sounds like common sense, and it is, but there's a lot of science that supports this <unk> based on how our space memory.
There's a structure in the brain called hippocampus, which has evolved over thousands of years, to make a location of the things that are important things -- where the fish are, where the fish are, which places the <unk> trees where tribes live and <unk>
The hippocampus is the part of the brain that was <unk> in the London <unk>
It's the part of the brain that allows the <unk> to find their nuts.
And if you ask if someone really did the experiment, they cut the <unk> sense of <unk> and they could still find her nuts.
They didn't use the nose, but the hippocampus, that very evolved mechanism of the brain to find things.
But it's really good for things that don't move much, not as good for things that move a lot.
This is the reason to lose keys from the car, reading and <unk>
So in front of it <unk> a place for keys, a hook on the door, maybe a <unk> dish.
For your passport, a particular drawer.
For your reading, a particular <unk>
If you take a place and they're <unk> with it your things always be there when the <unk>
What about <unk>
Take a picture of your credit cards, a photo of your credit card, passport, <unk> <unk> for themselves to be in the cloud.
If these things are lost or <unk> it can easier for <unk>
These are some of the most obvious things.
Remember, when you're under stress, the brain releases <unk>
<unk> is toxic and <unk> the thought.
So part of <unk> practice is to recognize that under stress we will not be at the best moment, and you have to put the systems on the site.
And there's perhaps no more stressful situation when you face to a medical decision.
And at some point, we will all be in that situation, that we have to make a very important decision about the future of our medical care or one being loved to help them with a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And I'll talk about a very particular medical condition.
But this is going to be <unk> as a <unk> for all sorts of medical decisions, and in fact to make financial decisions and in fact, for social decisions, any kind of decision that you have to take away from that we would benefit from a rational assessment of the facts.
So suppose you go to the doctor and the doctor says, "I've got the result of the lab and the cholesterol is a little bit <unk>
They all know that high cholesterol is associated with a greater risk of heart disease, attack the heart of <unk>
So you're thinking about having high cholesterol isn't the best, then the doctor says, "I'd like to <unk> a drug that will help to reduce the <unk> a <unk>
And you may have heard about the <unk> and he knows that it's one of the most <unk> drugs in the world today, even you're likely to know people who are <unk>
So you think, "Yes, <unk> <unk>
But there's a question that you have to do then, a statistic that you have to ask for the most doctors don't want to talk, and the pharmaceutical companies even less.
It's for <unk> the number necessary to treat.
And what is this, the <unk>
It's the number of people who have to take a drug or to submit to surgery in any medical procedure before you help one person.
And you must think of what kind of statistical statistic is <unk>
The number must be one.
My doctor would not give me something if not to help me.
But actually, medical practice doesn't work like this.
And it's not the fault of the doctor, and if it's fault from somebody, it's from scientists like me.
We have not understood very well <unk>
But the <unk> estimates that 90 percent of drugs works only about 30 to 50 percent of the people.
So the number you need to treat the most widely <unk> which is what you think is it?
How many people have to take it before you help one person?
300.
This is by the research of elected researchers <unk> <unk> and Pamela <unk> <unk> independently by <unk>
I explored the numbers.
300 people have to take the drug for a year before they would avoid a single heart attack or brain stroke or another <unk> event.
Now you might think, "Well, one probability in 300 of my <unk>
Why do not, <unk> <unk> the recipe for all <unk>
But then you have to ask for a more, and it is, <unk> of the <unk> effects. Right?
For this particular drug, the side effects are produced by five percent of the patients.
And those include things that are <unk> <unk> muscle pain and <unk> pain -- but now they think, 5 percent is not very likely to happen to me, even if you take the <unk>
But a moment.
remember that under stress doesn't think clearly.
So you think about how you can do this with time, so you don't have to make the string of reasoning on the act.
300 people take the drug, right? A person has <unk> five percent of the 300 have side effects, that are 15 people.
You have 15 times more likely to get it out of the drug to help you help you help you.
I don't say they had to take the <unk>
I just say you must have this conversation with your physician.
<unk> ethics is part of the beginning of informed consent.
We have the right to have access to this kind of information to start the conversation about whether you want to take the risks or not.
Maybe you're thinking that I've launched this number in the air for the value of the crash, but actually this number of time you need to deal with is quite typical.
For the surgery that is more done in the largest men in the 1950s, <unk> prostate from prostate cancer, the number of prostate to try is <unk>
That's what 49 surgeries for a person who has <unk>
And the side effects in that case, are produced by 50 percent of the patients.
Those include <unk> or dysfunction -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And if you're lucky, and it's one of that 50 percent of the effects just <unk> a year or two.
So the idea of <unk> is to think of before the questions that you can argue that we will make the conversation forward.
You don't have to do this in the act.
And they also want to think about the quality of life.
Because you have a choice many times, they want a shorter life in pain, or a longer life that could have a lot of pain to the end?
These are the things that they talk about and think about now, with their family and their loved ones.
You can change opinion in the heat of the moment, but at least you're trained in this kind of thought.
Remember, our brain releases <unk> under stress, and one of the things that happens at that moment is that it turns out a bunch of systems.
There's an evolutionary reason for this.
It doesn't need to face with a <unk> or the <unk> or the immune system, because if your body is spending the metabolism in those things, it doesn't react very quickly. They could get to be lunch of the lions, so none of that matter.
Unfortunately, one of the things that goes through the window during those moments of stress is the rational thought, like Danny <unk> and his colleagues have shown.
So we need to figure out how to think about the future of these kinds of situations.
I think what's important is to recognize that we are all <unk>
We're all going to fail to be then.
The idea is to think about the future how those <unk> to put the systems in the place that will help minimize harm, or to prevent the bad things in the first place.
I took on the night of snow in <unk> when I came back from my journey, and I installed a combination of combination with the door, with a key to the entry door in the same way, an easy way to remember it.
And I have to admit that I still have a lot of letters that I haven't ordered and lots of messages that I haven't seen.
So I'm not very organized, but I see the organization as a <unk> process, and I'm doing it.
Thank you very much.
Interpreter: <unk> <unk> is my favorite <unk>
It means playing <unk>
If you're playing a musical instrument, you see a <unk> in the <unk> you need to touch <unk>
Two <unk> even more gentle.
Four <unk> extremely smooth.
This is my drawing of a tree of <unk> there, you see it doesn't matter how many thousands and thousands of <unk> can never be done to a complete silence.
That's my current definition of <unk> a very dark sound.
I'd like to share a little bit about the history of the American system of signs, in addition to a little bit of my own story.
The language of the French signs came over the 1970s, and with the step of the time, it mixed up with local signs, and developed the language that we today know as a <unk>
So it has a story about 200 years.
I was born <unk> and I was taught that the sound was not a part of my life.
And I thought it was true.
But now I realize it's not true to nothing.
<unk> are a very important part of my life, they're actually in my mind every day.
As a <unk> person who lives in a world of sound, it's like I lived in a foreign country, following their rules, <unk> behaviors and norms and <unk>
So how do I understand sound <unk>
Well, I see how people behave and respond to sound.
People are like my speakers and <unk> the sound.
<unk> and <unk> that behavior.
At the same time, I've learned that I can create sound, and I've seen how people <unk>
So I've learned, for example ...
"I don't mean <unk>
"Don't do a lot of noise by eating the bag of potato <unk>
"Not <unk> and when you're eating, you know, <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
I call this <unk> <unk>
Maybe I think of sound tag more than the average person does it.
I'm super <unk> of the sounds.
And I'm always waiting for <unk> the sound, on which it's coming next.
From there, this drawing.
<unk> for decide.
<unk> to continue.
<unk> for <unk>
You can see that <unk> doesn't have notes on the lines.
That's because the lines contain sounds through the subtle <unk> and <unk>
In <unk> culture, movement is equivalent to sound.
This is the signal for <unk> in the <unk>
A typical <unk> has five lines.
However, to me, do it with my thumb -- it doesn't feel natural.
That's why my drawings only have four lines on paper.
In 2008, I had a chance to travel to Berlin, Germany, for an artistic residence there.
Before this time, I had worked like <unk>
During this summer, I visited museums and <unk> spaces, and as I went from one place to another, I realized that there was no visual art there.
At that moment, the sound was the trend and that called me the <unk>
There was no visual art, everything was <unk>
Now the sound has come into my art of art.
Is it going to ask me more of the art?
I realized it doesn't have to be like this.
In fact, I know the sound.
I know it so well that they don't just experience through the ears.
I can feel it in a <unk> way, or experience visually, or even as a idea.
So I decided to reclaim the sound of sound and <unk> in my art practice.
And all I had taught me in the sound of sound, I decided to leave it and <unk>
I started to create a new body of work.
And when I presented it to the art community, I was shocked with the number of support and attention that I got.
I realized that sound is like money, power -- the <unk> social currency.
On the bottom of my mind, I always felt that sound was <unk> it was a <unk> person.
And the sound is so powerful that it could be <unk> to me and my art work, or I could <unk>
I chose that I was <unk>
There's a massive culture around the spoken language.
And only because I don't use my literal voice to communicate, the eyes of society is like not having a voice at all.
So I have to work with people who can support me as well and become my voice.
So I'm able to be relevant to the current society.
So in school, in work, and institutions, work with many different performers of <unk>
And his voice becomes my voice and identity.
They help me be <unk>
And their voices have value and weight.
Ironically, at asking <unk> your voices, I'm able to maintain a temporary form of value for a way to take a loan with a very high interest rate.
If you won't continue with this practice, I feel that I could be able to get it in the <unk> and not have any social value.
So with the sound like my new artistic medium -- we would be in the world of music.
And I was amazed at seeing the similarities between music and <unk>
For example, a musical note is not able to capture and express fully on the paper.
And the same thing can say about a concept in <unk>
The two are very <unk> and highly <unk> which means that subtle changes can affect all the meaning as much of the signals as the sounds.
I'd like to share with you a metaphor for the piano, so you get better how the <unk> works.
So, imagine a piano.
<unk> is divided into many different <unk>
If you <unk> a different <unk> for each finger as the facial expression, the movement of the body, the movement of the body, the speed, the way of hand and so, as the piano, the English is a linear language -- as if you were <unk> just a key at the time.
However, <unk> is more like a <unk> you need the 10 fingers in the way to express a clear concept or idea in <unk>
If only one key would change the <unk> would create a completely different meaning.
Same thing happens with the music in terms of pitch, <unk> and volume.
In <unk> by using these different parameters <unk> you can express different ideas.
For example, the signal <unk> in that."
This is the signal <unk> in that."
I'm looking at you.
<unk> <unk>
Oh, <unk>
<unk> oh.
What are you <unk>
Oh, <unk>
So I started thinking, and if I look at the <unk> through the music?
If I had to create a sign and you put it over and again, it might be like a piece of visual music.
For example, this is the sign of <unk> the sun comes out and wears it.
This is every day.
If you put it up, and it <unk> the visually speed, it looks like a piece of music.
All day.
I feel that the same thing can be said by <unk> the <unk>
"All the <unk>
This is all night, on this drawing.
And this led me to think about three different types of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I feel that the third has more <unk> than the other two.
This represents how time is expressed in <unk> and how distance to body can express the changes in time.
For example, one <unk> is one hand, two <unk> is two hands, the present is closer and in front of the body, the future is in front of the body and the past is on the back.
So the first example is <unk> a lot of time."
Then, <unk> <unk> <unk> and the last one, which is my favorite, with a very romantic and dramatic idea at the same time, <unk> again."
<unk> <unk> is a musical term with a specific pace of four times by <unk>
However, when I see the word <unk> <unk> I think automatically in <unk>
Look at <unk> hand right -- <unk> left hand.
We have the <unk> through the head and the chest.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> I'm going to show you a way of your hand called <unk> <unk>
Can you do this with me?
Everyone in high hands.
Now we're going to do so much in the head like your chest, something like <unk> <unk> or <unk>
Yes, pretty well.
That means <unk> in the international system.
The international system, as a note, is a visual tool to help communicate in all cultures and signs of signs around the world.
The second one that I'd like to show you is this one. Please do it again.
And now this.
It means <unk> in the <unk>
Now, the third third. Please take away again.
And again.
It's <unk> in the <unk>
We're going to do three together.
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
Good job. all.
Notice how three signs are very similar. They all happen in the head and the chest. But they carry very different meanings on it.
It's amazing to see how <unk> is alive and thriving as the music.
However, today, we live in a very <unk> world.
And only because the <unk> doesn't have sound, automatically does not have social value.
We need to start questioning what defines social value and allow <unk> to develop their own value, without sounds.
And this could be a step to make a more <unk> society.
And maybe people understand that you don't have to be deaf, to learn <unk> and don't have to hear to learn music.
<unk> is a rich trove of trove and I'd like they had the same experience.
I'd like to give you your ears, open your eyes, to participate in our culture and experience our visual language.
And you never know, you can fall in love with us.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> Hey, that's me.
As a child, my parents would say, "You can do everything, but then you have to <unk>
The freedom involves responsibility.
But my imagination led to all these wonderful places, where everything was possible.
So I grew up in an innocence of innocence or a bubble of ignorance -- I should say, because adults would lie to protect us from the horrible truth.
When I got older, I found out that adults also understand, and that they're not very good for cleaning up others.
The country, now I'm adult and I teach citizenship and invention in Hong Kong.
You don't have to wait a lot for my students to walk through the beach with lots of garbage.
So as good citizens, cleaned up the <unk> and no, it's not drinking alcohol, and if it is, I don't get it <unk>
It's sad to say, but more than 80 percent of the oceans of the oceans have plastic.
It's kind of creepy.
And in the last few decades, we've been coming out with these big vessels and networks to collect those pieces of plastic to study them under the microscope, and the <unk> and <unk> this information on a map.
But it lasts for an eternity and it's very expensive and also it's very risky to use those huge boats
So along with my students, with ages six to 15 years, we dream about a better way.
We've transformed our little classroom in Hong Kong in a workshop.
We started building this <unk> <unk> work for the kids who are very <unk> they can also participate.
And I will tell you the kids who manipulate electrical tools are great and secure.
Not exactly.
Let's go back to plastic.
We collect plastic and reduce it to the size that we found in the ocean, which is very small, because of its <unk>
So we do.
I leave it to the imagination of my students.
My job is to try to take the best ideas in every single child, and try to figure out something that we hope to work.
We decided instead of collecting pieces of plastic, just <unk> information.
So through the use of a robot, we took a picture of this <unk> the kids will be very excited with robots.
And then we set up quickly what we call "a <unk>
We are so quickly in creating prototypes that we ended up before I had lunch.
And we transform lights and web cameras, and you put it into a floating robot that will move slowly through the water and by the plastic that we have there, and this is the image captured by the robot.
We see the pieces of plastic floating slowly through the sensor as the computer computer on board would process this image, and measuring the size of each <unk> to get a range estimate of the number of plastic in the water.
<unk> this invention step on a website to inventors called <unk> with the hope that someone else will get it even more.
The cool thing about this project is that students saw a local problem, and <unk> are trying to solve it immediately.
And I am looking at my problem with it, but my students in Hong Kong are very well.
Do you see the news, <unk> the Internet, and you get rid of this thing.
A child, probably less than 10 years, cleaning up a oil spill, just using the hands, in <unk> the largest largest forest in the world in Bangladesh.
They were very surprised because this is the water that <unk> is the water where the water is going to spread out the water where they live, the place where they live.
You can also see that the water is brown, the mud and the oil is also brown in brown color, and when it's all <unk> it's very hard to see what's in the water.
But there's a simple technology called <unk> which allows you to see what's in the water.
So we built a first prototype of a <unk> which can spread through all kinds of substances that produce different <unk> which can help identify what there is in the water.
So let's put this prototype with a sensor and send it to Bangladesh.
The cool thing about this project is that beyond solving a local problem, or to analyze a local problem, my students used their empathy and their sense of creativity to help both other children.
I was able to investigate a problem with <unk> I was forced to do a second experiment, and I wanted to go a little further away, maybe to address a more difficult problem, and also closer to me.
I'm half Japanese and French half and perhaps remember, in 2011, there was a devastating earthquake in Japan.
It was so violent that it started several giant waves called <unk> and those <unk> were <unk> several cities on the coast of Japan.
More than 14,000 people died in a moment.
It also gives the nuclear power plant of Fukushima, a nuclear headquarters on the water.
And today, according to the reports on an average of 300 tons still leaking out of the nuclear plant in the Pacific Ocean.
Today, all the Pacific Ocean has traces of pollution by <unk>
If we go to the west coast, we can measure the radiation of <unk> everywhere.
But if you look at the map, it seems that most of the radiation disappeared from the Japanese coast -- and most of the time, it has a safe thing, it's blue.
Well, the reality is a little bit more complicated than that.
And I've come back to <unk> every year from the accident and research independently with other scientists, the land, the river, and this time we wanted to bring the kids.
Of course not the <unk> the parents don't get it.
But every night you go to the center of <unk> here you see the use of different masks
It might seem like they did not take work seriously, but they did it because they're going to have to live with the <unk> all of your life.
Together with them, we discussed the data <unk> that day and we talked about what we were going to do next, <unk> the <unk> and so on.
And to do this, we created a <unk> map of the region around the plant of nuclear power.
We created the map of <unk> <unk> <unk> to represent data in real time from <unk> and <unk> water to simulate the rain.
We were able to notice that the radioactive powder will spread from the top of the mountain to the <unk> system, and <unk> in the ocean.
It was a <unk> <unk>
But based on this we organized an civil expedition the nearest to the nuclear power to date.
We zoom up to a mile from the nuclear station, and with the foreign assistance of the area we were collecting sediments from the sea bed with a <unk> <unk> as we invented and we've built.
Here we see a <unk> we've gone from a local problem to a remote problem to a global problem.
And it's been very exciting to work on these different scales, also with open source technologies and very simple.
But at the same time, it's been increasingly frustrating because we've only been starting to measure the damage we've done.
We haven't even started trying to solve the problems.
I wonder if we should give the leap and try to invent better ways to do all these things.
So the classroom became a little bit smaller and so we found an industrial installation in Hong Kong and we turn it into the largest space dedicated to social and environmental impact.
It's in the center of Hong Kong and it's a place where we can work with wood metal, chemistry, a little bit of biology, you basically can build almost everything there.
It's also a place where adults and children can play together.
It's a place where the dreams of children can actually become reality with adults, and where adults can be children again.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> We asked things like, we can invent the future of mobility with <unk> energy.
So for example.
Or can we help in the mobility of the advanced age transforming their standard wheels in new <unk> vehicles.
The plastic, oil and oil and <unk> are <unk> terrible, but the worst legacy we can leave our children are the lies.
We cannot afford to protect the children of the horrible truth because we need their imagination to invent the solutions.
So the scientific citizen, creators, <unk> we need to make the next generation for the environment and people, and so it really can do something about it.
Thank you.
Two domes <unk> two <unk> of radically opposite design.
One is made out of thousands of steel pieces of steel, the other one of the silk silk.
One of them is synthetic -- the other organic one.
One is the <unk> on the environment, the other one believed it.
One is designed by nature, the other for it.
Michelangelo said when he looked at the <unk> <unk> he saw a figure that is fighting to be free.
The <unk> was only a <unk> tool.
But living beings are not <unk>
They grow.
And in the smallest units of life, the cells, we took all the information for every cell to work and for <unk>
The tools also have consequences.
At least since the Industrial Revolution, the world of design has been dominated by <unk> of manufacturing and production production.
<unk> lines have dictated a world made out of parts, <unk> the imagination of designers and architects to think of their objects as <unk> of different parts of different different functions.
But you don't find <unk> material in nature.
Think of human skin, for example.
Our facial skins are thin with <unk> <unk>
The skins of the back are <unk> with little <unk>
One acts mainly as a filter, the other mainly like barrier, and yet it's the same <unk> there is no parts, no <unk>
It's a system that makes gradually its functionality through the variation of <unk>
Here's a broken screen that represents my vision of the world <unk> the double <unk> of every designer and architect to work on the <unk> and the gene, between the machine and the gene, between the assembly and the organism, between Henry Ford and Charles Darwin.
These two visions of the world, my left hemisphere, and the right hemisphere, analytics and activated -- it shows in the two screens after me.
My work, in the most simple level, tries to bring these two visions of the world, away from assembly and approaching growth.
You probably want to ask, why now?
Why was it not possible about 10 or even five years?
We live in a very special moment in history, a rare moment, where they have four disciplines that offers designers to tools that we had never had access to before.
And at the intersection of these four fields, my team and I create.
Please meet the minds and the hands of my students.
We're designing objects, products, structures and tools through scale, large-scale scales, like this robotic arm with a <unk> of the diameter with a <unk> to force that one day not too far to print <unk> buildings, and graphs to the nanoscale <unk> made of genetically <unk> that they glow in the dark.
Here we have <unk> the <unk> a archetype of the ancient Arab architecture, and has created a screen where every aperture is the only one to shape the shape of light and heat through it.
In our next project, we explored the possibility of creating a layer and a <unk> and this was for a fashion <unk> of Paris with <unk> they're <unk> It's like a second skin made from one piece, <unk> in the flexible <unk> around the waist.
Together with printing 3D printing of 3D printing -- we print this layer and <unk> 3D <unk> between the cells.
This hull combines <unk> materials and <unk> in the resolution of 20 <unk>
This is the resolution of a human hair.
It's also the resolution of a brain scanner, too.
That designers have access to this very high-resolution analytical and the instruments that are allowing them to design the products that are <unk> not just the way our bodies, but also the physiological structure of our tissues.
We've also designed a acoustic chair, a little chair that makes comfortable and also sound sound.
The Carter professor, my collaborator, went back to nature to <unk> and by designing this <unk> pattern -- it becomes <unk>
<unk> this <unk> of 44 different properties that vary in <unk> <unk> and color, <unk> the pressure points in the human body.
Its surface, as in nature, vary its functionality not through the addition of another material or another <unk> but continuously <unk> and <unk> the material.
But it's the <unk> nature.
There is no parts in nature?
I was not raised in a religious Jew but when I was young, my grandmother tells me the stories of the Bible <unk> and one of them got to me and actually define a lot of what I care about.
As she said, "In the third day of <unk> God send the Earth to grow a tree -- <unk> <unk>
For that first <unk> tree there would be no difference between <unk> branches, leaves and <unk>
The whole tree was a piece of <unk>
Instead, the Earth was growing trees with branches, <unk> <unk> and flowers.
The land created a world made of parts.
I often ask myself, "What would design if objects were made of one piece <unk>
<unk> a better state of the <unk>
So we are looking for the material -- the kind of material of the tree of <unk> with fruits, and we found it.
The second <unk> <unk> on the planet is called <unk> and about 100 million tons produced every year by organisms like shrimp, and <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
We think that if we could tune your property, we could generate structures that are built into one piece.
So that's what we did.
We call it <unk> <unk>  We asked a lot of <unk> of <unk> the <unk> and collected <unk>
<unk> the chemical concentrations -- we've been able to achieve a wide range of properties, from <unk> hard and <unk> to light, soft and transparent.
To print the <unk> structures that built a system with multiple <unk> <unk> <unk>
The robot could vary the properties of material on the march and create these structures made out of one material three -- 100 percent recycled.
When the pieces are lists, it stops dry up to find a natural form of contact with the air.
So why do we keep designing with <unk>
The air bubbles that were a byproduct of the printing process was used to contain <unk> <unk> that first time on planet three billion years ago, like we heard yesterday.
Together with our collaborators at Harvard and MIT <unk> bacteria engineered to capture rapidly carbon from the atmosphere and turn it into sugar.
For the first time, we've been able to generate structures that make their transition from <unk> to mesh, and if it develops even more, to windows.
A tree -- <unk> <unk>
Working with an ancient material, one of the first forms of life on the planet, with abundant water and with a synthetic biology, we have transformed a structure made of <unk> of shrimp in an architecture that behaves like a tree.
And here is the best fat for objects that are designed for <unk> put in the sea, <unk> life and placed on the ground, they'll help grow a tree.
The match for our next exploration using the same principles of design was the solar system.
We are looking for the possibility of creating clothes to keep the lives for <unk>
To do that, we need to master bacteria and control their flow.
So as the table, <unk> we did our own table of <unk> new forms of life created <unk> made of <unk> and <unk> <unk>
And I like to think about synthetic biology like the liquid <unk> just that instead of <unk> metals that are <unk> and new basic functions inside very small channels.
This field is called <unk>
We were able to put our own 3D channels to control the flow of these <unk> <unk>
In our first piece of clothes, we were <unk> two microorganisms.
The first is <unk>
It lives in our oceans and the <unk>
And second, E. <unk> the bacteria that inhabit the human intestine in the human intestine in the human intestine in the human intestine in the human intestine in the human intestine in the human intestine in the human intestine in the human intestine in the human intestine in the human intestine in the human intestine in the human intestine in the human intestine in the human intestine in the human
One becomes the light in sugar, the other <unk> and it produces some useful biofuels for the built environment.
But these two microorganisms doesn't interact in nature.
In fact, they never <unk>
They are here, designed for the first time, to have a relationship in a piece of clothes.
Think of it as evolution, not natural selection, but evolution by design.
In order to contain these relationships, we've created a single channel that looks like the <unk> tract that will help you build these bacteria and to make it <unk> their way.
So we started to grow those channels in the human body, <unk> the properties of material according to the functionality itself.
If we wanted more <unk> it was more transparent channels.
This system would be able to <unk> when it stretches from one end to another, it goes 60 feet.
This is half the length of a football field, and 10 times more than our gut <unk>
And here it is, as a <unk> at TED, our first <unk> <unk> channels in my clothes.
Thank you.
Mary <unk> said, "We are youngest creatures, only half is <unk>
What if design would give the other <unk>
And if we could create structures that increase the <unk>
And if we could create personal <unk> that we prescribe our skin, <unk> the tissue destroyed and <unk> our <unk>
Think of this as a way of editing biology.
I call this material ecology.
For that, you always have to go back to nature.
So now, you know that a 3D printer knows material in layers.
You also know that nature doesn't do this.
<unk> <unk> with <unk>
This cocoon of <unk> for example, creates a highly sophisticated architecture -- a home within which they are <unk>
<unk> manufacturing is about this level of <unk>
It does it through the combination of two materials, but two different proteins in different <unk>
One acts as a structure, the other is the glue or the matrix, put those fibers into each other.
And this is happening through scales.
The silk worm first becomes the environment, creates a tension, of tension, and then starts to <unk> a cocoon of compression.
<unk> and <unk> the two forces of life, they manifest themselves in a single material.
In order to understand how this complex process works, we attach a small magnet to the head of a silk worm to the <unk>
We put it into a box with magnetic sensors, and that allowed us to create this cloud of points in three dimensions and visualize the complex architecture of cocoon of silk <unk>
However, when you put the silk worm into a flat patch -- not within a box, we realized that <unk> a flat cocoon and still <unk> <unk>
So we started designing different parts of different <unk> and we've discovered that shape, the composition, the structure of the <unk> was transmitted directly by the environment.
They often <unk> the silk worms to death in their <unk> their silk is <unk> and it's used in the <unk> industry.
We saw that designing these templates we can shape silk silk without boiling a single <unk>
It <unk> <unk> and we could create these things.
So we climbed this process up to the architectural scale.
We had a robot <unk> making silk, and we put it into our site.
We knew that silk worms are going to be more dark and <unk> and <unk> so we use a solar diagram diagram to reveal the distribution of light and heat into our structure.
So we create holes or <unk> to block the rays of light and heat -- it will break the silk worms on the structure.
We were ready to get the <unk>
We asked <unk> <unk> to a silk farm online.
And after <unk> four weeks ago, they were prepared to get us with us.
We put them carefully on the bottom of the <unk> and as they <unk> <unk> they <unk> <unk> and life starts again, like us, but much, much more short.
<unk> Fuller said that tension is the great integrity, and it was right.
By <unk> biological silk about <unk> <unk> they give all this pavilion and integrity.
And in a little bit more than two or three weeks, <unk> silk worms -- <unk> <unk>
In a curious symmetry, this is also the length of the silk route, too.
<unk> after the <unk> produce 1.5 million eggs.
This could be used for 250 extra <unk> in the future.
So here are the two visions of the world.
A silk <unk> through a robotic arm, the other full of gaps.
If the latest frontier of design is to give up the products and the buildings around us to form a ecology of two materials, the designers must bring these two visions of the world.
Which brings us back, of course, at the beginning.
Here's a new era of design, a new era of the creation, that leads us from a design inspired by nature to an inspired nature of us, which requires us, for the first time, which we do in charge of nature.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Hands up if you've ever asked you what you want to be <unk>
If you had to remember what age they had when they asked them for the first time.
They can stick with your fingers.
Three. Five. Three. Five. Five.
Now, raise your hand if the question is, "What do you want to be <unk>
It has caused them some kind of anxiety.
Any anxiety.
I'm somebody who could never answer the question, "What do you want to be <unk>
The problem wasn't that I didn't have any interest, but I had <unk>
In school I liked the English English, the <unk> and the art and research online, and I was playing the guitar in a rock band called <unk> <unk>
Maybe you've heard about us.
And generally I like to test and persist anyway, because I have spent a lot of time and energy and sometimes money in this field.
But with the time this sense of <unk> this sense of, this is not a challenge, it comes to <unk>
And I have to get it back.
But then I was excited about something else -- something totally different, and I'm going to focus on it, and let me absorb and feel <unk> I've found the <unk> and then again, this point where I start to <unk>
And finally, I want to move back.
But then I'd like to discover something new and different, and I'd like to go into that.
This pattern caused me a lot of anxiety, for two reasons.
The first one was because I wasn't sure how I was going to turn this whole thing into a career.
I thought I had to choose one thing, denied all of my other passions and <unk> to <unk>
Another reason that caused me so much was a little more personal.
I was worried that there was something wrong with this, and something wrong with me not <unk> at all.
I was concerned to have a fear of commitment, or whether or to <unk> or my own success.
If you can relate to my story and these feelings, I would like to ask you something that I'd like to have raised me then.
<unk> themselves, where they learned to allocate the meaning of evil or abnormal to do things.
I will tell you where they did, they learned it from culture.
Do you ask ourselves, "What do you want to be <unk>
When we have about five years.
And the truth is that nobody cares about what they were going to be at that age.
It's considered a naive issue to cause nice answers in children like, <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> or want to be <unk>
<unk> the <unk> <unk> here.
This question is done again and again as we are growing up in various ways, <unk> <unk> to high school students, you ask them to choose in college.
And at some point, "What do you want to be <unk>
It happens to be the nice exercise of before it takes us to get the dream.
Why?
If this question inspires kids to dream with what they might be, it doesn't inspire dreaming of everything that they might be.
In fact, it does exactly the opposite, because when someone asks you what you want to be, you can't respond to 20 different things, even though adults are good enough, you might be <unk> and say, "Oh, what cute, you can't be <unk> and <unk>
You have to <unk>
This is Dr. Bob <unk>  and he's <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And this <unk> Amy turned into <unk> <unk> teacher and <unk>
But most of the kids don't hear about people like this.
All you hear is they will have to choose.
But it's more than that.
The notion of life is very <unk> in our culture.
It's this idea of fate or the real <unk> the idea that each of us has something to do for your time on this land, and you have to figure out what's that thing and devote your life to it.
But if you're someone who's not connected to this way?
What if there are a lot of different issues that wake up their curiosity and a lot of different things that you want to do?
There's no place for someone like one in that framework.
And so you can feel alone.
You can feel that you have no goal.
And there is something wrong with you.
There's nothing wrong with you.
You are a <unk>
A <unk> is somebody with many interests and creative activities.
It's a <unk> so say.
It could help if you divide into three parts: multiple <unk> and <unk>
You can also be able to use other terms that we would use the same idea, like <unk> <unk>
Over the age of the Renaissance, the ideal was who was well <unk> in multiple disciplines.
Barbara <unk> refers to us as a <unk>
<unk> any term you like or <unk> your own.
It seems like a kind of fit to a community, we can't agree with one single identity.
It's easy to see the <unk> as a limitation or <unk> you must win.
But what I've learned about talking to people and writing about these ideas on my website, is that there are huge strengths in this way.
Here's three superpowers <unk>
One: synthesis of ideas.
I mean, the combination of two or more fields and creating something new in <unk>
<unk> <unk> and Rachel <unk> <unk> their shared interests in cartography, visualization of data, travel, mathematics and design, to <unk>
<unk> is a company that creates jewelry <unk>
A <unk> and Rachel came up with this unique idea of his <unk> mix of skills and experiences.
Innovation happens at intersections.
There are the new ideas.
And <unk> with all its background, you can access a lot of these points of <unk>
The second superpower <unk> is learning quickly.
When we put them up, we just go to it.
We look at everything we can have in our hands.
We're used to <unk> because they have been a lot of times in the past, and this means that we are less afraid of testing new things and out of our comfort.
A lot of skills are <unk> to other disciplines, and we bring everything that we have learned to every new area that we have, so we rarely start from scratch.
<unk> <unk> is a <unk> to complete and <unk>
As a girl pianist <unk> an incredible ability to develop muscle memory.
Now, she's the fastest <unk>
Before I become a writer, I was <unk> financial <unk>
He had to learn the fine sales mechanics when they were starting their practices, and this ability helps to write compelling launches for the editors.
<unk> is rarely a loss of time to spend what you would tell you, even if at the end of the end.
Is it possible to apply that knowledge in a completely different field, in a way that you couldn't have <unk>
The third superpower <unk> is adaptability. It's the adaptability.
<unk> <unk> is sometimes director of videos, a web designer designer, sometimes consultant from Kickstarter, sometimes teacher, and, sometimes, James <unk>
It's valuable because it makes a good job.
He's even more valuable because it can take any different <unk> depending on the needs of your customers.
<unk> Company Company defines adaptability as the most important skill for development, to thrive in the 21st century.
The economic world changes so rapidly and <unk> that are the individuals and organizations that can help us to meet the needs of the market, the ones that are really <unk>
<unk> of ideas, quickly learning and <unk> three skills where the <unk> are very <unk> and three skills that could lose if they're a <unk> to reduce their goals.
As a society, we have a great interest in encouraging <unk> to be themselves.
We have complex problems, <unk> right now, and we need creative thinkers to deal with them.
Let's say they are, in your heart heart, <unk>
<unk> on the belly knowing that they wanted to be <unk> <unk>
Don't worry, there's nothing wrong with you either.
In fact, some of the best teams get up from a specialist and a <unk> <unk>
<unk> can dive into depth and put in practice ideas, and the <unk> offers a amplitude of knowledge to the project.
It's a beautiful relationship.
But we should all be designing lives and careers that are going to deal with how we are connected.
And unfortunately, the <unk> in a big part are being told to just be more like their fellow <unk>
And once I said this, if there's one thing you take out of this talk, I hope it's this: <unk> with the internal wiring whatever it is.
If you're a heart doctor, then <unk> for all media.
That's where you will give the best of it.
But for the <unk> in the room, including those who just realized being one of them in the last 12 minutes,  I say, <unk> with your many passions.
Keep his curiosity for those <unk> <unk>
I would see the intersections.
<unk> our inner wiring leads us to a more authentic and happy life.
And perhaps most importantly, <unk> the world will <unk> us.
Thank you.
In the year <unk> a woman named <unk> was taken to a psychiatric <unk>
<unk> <unk> and I couldn't remember even the most basic details of your life.
His doctor was called <unk>
<unk> I didn't know how to help <unk> but <unk> for her until it passed away from <unk>
After his death, <unk> did a <unk> and they found weird plates and <unk> in the <unk> brain of a guy who had never seen before.
The even more amazing thing.
If <unk> had been living today, we couldn't give it to her more aid than the one that he was going, he gave him <unk>
<unk> was Dr. <unk> Alzheimer's.
And <unk> <unk> the first patient to get a diagnosis that we now call disease.
From <unk> the medicine has advanced a lot.
You have been discovered antibiotics and vaccines to protect us from the <unk> a lot of treatments for cancer, <unk> for HIV, <unk> for <unk> and much more.
But a little bit has made progress on Alzheimer's disease.
I'm part of a team of scientists working to find a cure for Alzheimer's for more than a decade.
So I think about this all the time.
Alzheimer's now affects 40 million across the world.
But by 2050, it will affect 150 million which, by the way, include many of you.
If you expect to live up to 85 years or more, the ability to get Alzheimer's will be almost one of each two.
In other words, there is the probability that you have to spend their years from Alzheimer's or Alzheimer's or helping to take care of a friend or want to be dear disease.
In America alone, Alzheimer's care costs 200 billion dollars every year.
One of five dollars of healthcare is spent on Alzheimer's disease.
Today it's the most expensive disease and its costs -- a increase in five times in 2050, by 2050, as the generation of <unk> boom.
I may surprise you, but Alzheimer's is one of the greatest medical and social challenges of our generation.
But it's been relatively little to <unk>
Today, one of the first 10 causes of death all over the world, Alzheimer's is the only one that cannot be able to cure or even slow their development.
We understand less than Alzheimer's than other diseases than we have invested less time and money in the research of itself.
The U.S. government spends 10 times more every year in the cancer research in Alzheimer's matter despite the fact that it costs us more Alzheimer's and causes a number of a annual number of deaths like cancer.
The lack of resources is due to a more fundamental cause, the lack of consciousness.
Because this is what little people knows, but everyone else is <unk> Alzheimer's is a disease, and we can <unk>
For most of the last couple of years, all of us, all of us, of course, is the scientific scientists, Alzheimer's disease with aging.
We think it's going to be <unk> in a normal and inevitable part of aging.
But you only have to look at a picture of a healthy adult brain compared to the patient's Alzheimer's patient to see the actual physical damage caused by this disease.
In addition to trigger a severe loss of memory and skill skills, the damage to the brain caused the brain by Alzheimer's percent of the life expectancy and is always deadly.
Remember, Dr. Alzheimer's found plates and <unk> strangers in the <unk> brain, a century ago.
For nearly a century, we didn't know a lot about this.
We now know that they're made of protein molecules.
You can think of a protein molecule like a piece of paper that folds as a origami.
There are places in the paper that are <unk>
And when it folds well, these dots come up in the inside.
But sometimes things go wrong, and some dots <unk> stay on the outside.
This makes the protein molecules <unk> each other, forming groups that can form large plates and <unk>
That's what we see in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's.
We've spent the last 10 years at Cambridge University trying to understand how this <unk> works.
There's a lot of steps, and the identification of what step step is complex, like a bomb.
<unk> a cable could do anything.
<unk> others can make the bomb <unk>
You have to find the right step that we did, and then create a drug that does.
Until recently, most of you have reduced the wires and waited for the best.
But now there is a diverse group of people, doctors, biologists -- <unk> physical, engineers, and mathematicians.
And together, we've managed to identify a critical step in the process. It's now testing a new kind of drugs that block specifically this step to stop the disease.
I'll show you some of our last results.
No one outside of our lab has seen it yet.
Let's look at some videos of what happened to test these drugs in <unk>
These are the healthy worms -- and you can see that they move normally.
These worms on the other hand, have molecules of protein that stick into each other within them, like humans with Alzheimer's.
And you can see that they're clearly sick.
But by giving our new drugs to these worms at an early stage, then we see that <unk> and live a normal life.
This is just a positive outcome, but research as this sample that Alzheimer's is a disease that we can understand and cure.
After <unk> years of <unk> there is real hope that can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years.
But to grow that hope, to overcome Alzheimer's disease, we need help.
It's not scientists like me, it's about you.
We must agree that Alzheimer's is a disease and that if we do it, we can <unk>
In the case of other diseases, the patients and their families have <unk> more research and <unk> pressure on governments, <unk> scientists and <unk>
That was essential to progress on HIV treatment in the late 1980s.
Today we see that same unit to overcome cancer.
But Alzheimer's patients often can't talk about themselves.
And their families, the hidden victims of their loved ones and night, are often too <unk> to go out and advocate for change.
So, it really depends on you.
Alzheimers is not in most cases a genetic disease.
Everyone with a brain runs the risk.
Today, there are 40 million patients like <unk> who cannot create the change that they need for themselves.
<unk> talking about them, and help demand a cure.
Thank you.
I had this article in the New York Times, in the New York Times, in January of this year.
To fall in love with somebody, I do this.
The article is about a psychological study designed to create romantic love in the lab, and from my own experience to test it -- I was just a night last summer.
So the procedure is quite simple: Two strangers will become <unk> to get the more and more personal questions, and then they both look at the eyes without talking for four minutes.
Here's a couple of questions of example.
Number two: If you could wake up tomorrow with a quality or skill, which would be?
Number two: When was the last time you would get to another person?
And <unk>
In <unk> they're getting more personal and more personal.
Number two: <unk> really <unk> me to your partner -- what you like to him, or she -- I know very sincere this time, and I gave things that you don't say to someone you've recently met.
When I came across this study a few years ago, a really struck me really struck me, the piece that two of the participants had married six months later, and invited all of the lab to the <unk>
So it was <unk> about this process of making romantic love, but of course, I was also <unk>
And when I had the time to test this study, with someone who knew not particularly very well, I didn't expect <unk>
However, we were <unk> and --  And I thought it was a good story, so I send them to the Spanish neocortical column a few months later.
That was published in January, and now it's already <unk> so I guess some of you might probably want to ask, they still follow together.
And the reason I think you challenge this is because I have done this question again and again in the last seven months.
And this question is just what I want to talk about today.
But let's go back to the subject.
One week before the article was published, I was very nervous.
I had been working on a romantic book in the last few years, so I had <unk> to write about my experience in romantic love on my blog.
But one blog entrance can come to a few hundred views like a lot, and those were usually just about my Facebook friends, and I imagined that my article in the New York Times would have a few thousand of those.
And that found a good charge of attention in a relatively new relationship.
But as he gave it out, I had no idea.
The paper was published on a Friday night, and then the Saturday, this happened on my blog.
And Sunday already had been called the "Today Show and "Good <unk> <unk>
In a month, the article received over eight million pages, and I was, I was saying something, little prepared for this kind of attention.
One thing is to foster trust writing about their own <unk> experiences, but another thing is to discover that the loving life of one has been international news --  and that people around the world are really interested in the state of your new relationship.
And when people named or <unk> what they did every day for weeks, they were all doing the same question: still still together?
In fact, when I was preparing this talk, I did a quick search for my email on my email with the phrase: <unk> <unk>
And several messages appeared immediately.
They were from students and journalists and strange <unk> like this.
I was interviewed on radio and <unk>
Even, I gave a talk, and a woman screamed up to the stage, "Hey <unk> where is your <unk>
And I immediately became red.
I understand that this is part of the deal.
If you write about your relationship in a international day, you should expect people to feel comfortable asking about it.
But I wasn't prepared for the wingspan of the answer.
The 36 questions seemed to have <unk> life <unk>
In fact, the New York Times ran a <unk> article for St. <unk> who included the experience of readers to prove the study in them with different degrees of success.
So my first impulse to all of this attention was to be very <unk> with my own relationship.
I said not to every request that we both did a public emergence together.
I would pick up TV interviews, and <unk> for photos of us two.
I think I was afraid to become the <unk> of the <unk> process, a range for the one that I didn't feel at the absolute <unk>
And I understand that people didn't want to know only if the study worked, and they wanted to know if it was actually capable of producing love <unk> not just an adventure, but real love, love <unk>
But this was a question that I didn't feel able to respond.
My relationship was just a few months, and I felt, especially people who made the wrong question.
How do you know if you were going together or not, and also <unk>
If the answer was not, it would make the experience of doing these 36 questions less interesting?
Dr. Arthur <unk> wrote first about these questions in this same study in 1997. And there, the goal of researcher was not to produce romantic love.
Rather than that, I was looking for interpersonal <unk> among college students, using what <unk> called <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Sounds romantic, right?
But the study does work.
The participants were closer to the closer of doing it, and several new studies -- they were also used by <unk> <unk> <unk> as a rapid way of creating trust and interaction between strangers.
They have used it between members of the police and the community and the community of the community, and they've used it between people in the opposite political <unk>
The original version of history, which I tried last summer, that combines personal questions with four minutes of visual contact, it was cited in this paper, but unfortunately it never got published.
A few months ago, I was giving a talk in a little liberal arts university, and then a student came up to me and told me with <unk> <unk> the study and didn't work.
He seemed to <unk> for it.
And I said, "Do you want to say that you would get away from the person with whom you do it.
Well he did a break.
I think she just wants us to be friends.
And I said, but they became better friends?
<unk> that they managed to get better after testing the <unk>
The <unk>
So, <unk> I said.
However, I don't think that was the answer that he was looking for.
In fact, I don't think it's the answer that any of you are looking for when it comes to love.
I stumbled across the studio for the first time when I was 29 and I was going through a really hard separation of it.
He had had that relationship since I had 20, what I was supposed to most of my adult life, and he was my first real love, and I had no idea how or I could live without it.
So I was focusing on science.
And I did all that I could find about the science of romantic love, and I expected that that could be some form of <unk> the heart.
I don't know if I realized this at the moment, I thought only research for the book I would write -- but in retrospect, it really looks like <unk>
I thought that if I was involved with the knowledge of romantic love, I would never have to feel so bad and used to feel as bad as I was then.
And all of this knowledge has been useful from one or another way.
I'm more patient with love. I'm more <unk>
I have more trust to demand what I'm after.
But I can also see me more clearly, and I can realize that what I'm looking for is sometimes more than reasonably much more than it can demand me.
What I'm looking for of love is an agent -- not just to be <unk> today and being <unk> tomorrow, but I will continue to be <unk> indefinitely by the person I love.
It may be that this is the guarantee that people asked when they wanted to know if they were still together.
The story that the media said about the 36 questions is that there may be a shortcut to <unk>
There may be a way to mitigate some of the risk of risk -- and this is a very <unk> story, because in love makes us feel <unk> but it's also frightening.
But I think when it comes to love, we're very willing to accept the short version of history.
The version of the story that question: still go together?
And your content with an answer of Yes or No.
So more than a question, <unk> that we ask more difficult, questions like, how do you decide who deserves your love and who doesn't?
How do you stay in love when things get together, and how to know when to cut and <unk>
How do you live with uncertainty that inevitably leads to a relationship? Or even more, how do you live with your <unk>
I don't necessarily necessarily ask answers to these questions, but I think they're a good beginning to have a more <unk> conversation about what it means to love someone.
So if you want the short version of my relationship, it's <unk> a year ago, and we applied a study designed to create romantic love, we will create romantic love, we still follow together, and I'm very <unk>
But in love is not the same thing that will remain <unk>
<unk> is the easy part.
So at the end of my article. The love didn't happen.
<unk> in love because we took the choice to be.
And I <unk> a little bit at the reading now, not because it's not true, but because at the moment, there was no anything that was supposed to do.
I didn't think it was how many times we would have to make that decision, and how much times I will have to keep doing that choice without knowing before he will always choose or not.
I want you to be enough to have done and they responded for 36 questions, to have chosen to love someone as generous, kind and a fun guy, and there was expressed that choice in the largest newspaper in the United States.
But what I've done, instead is turning my relationship into the kind of myth that I don't really do.
And what I did, and what I might spend my life looking for is that that myth is true.
I want the happy end of implicit in the title of my paper, which is, by the way, the only part of the article that I didn't actually wrote.
But what I have in change is the opportunity to love somebody, and the hope that he was also love, and it's <unk> but that's the deal with love.
Thank you.
I was raised by some lesbian <unk> and in a certain way I got a <unk> of the forest.
A long time in New York does a time a time.  One that really affected me but more details later on.
I'm going to start with when I was eight years old.
I took a box of wood, and I took a dollar ticket to a dollar, a pen and a fork in her somewhere in Colorado.
And I thought that some strange <unk> or some aliens find this box about 500 years later and <unk> how our species would do, ideas, for example how we eat <unk>
I had no idea.
Anyway, it has grace because here I am, 30 years later, and I'm still doing boxes.
And at a moment I was in <unk> <unk> like going to come up and make <unk> and all of those things <unk> and I was doing a collage for my mother.
And I took a dictionary and I took it all the pages and I took all the pages and I made a kind of <unk> <unk> to the Agnes Martin, the covered in resin, and a bee held <unk>
Well, my mother is afraid of bees and it's <unk> to them, so I added more resin in the canvas, thinking that I could <unk>
Instead, the opposite: it kind of seemed like it turned out of size, as if it was that they would take the text with a <unk>
So I did <unk> I built more boxes.
This time, I began to add electronic elements, frogs, strange bottles that I was finding out the street, everything I could find, because I was looking for things all my life, trying to <unk> and tell stories about these objects.
So I started drawing around the objects, and I realized that God can draw in space.
I can flow <unk> to draw just like a <unk> in the scene of crime.
And I took out the objects and created my own taxonomy of specimens by <unk>
First of all, <unk> you can get an idea.
Then I made some insects and weird creatures.
It was very fun to draw in the layers of <unk>
And it was great, because I started building exhibitions and those things, and I was earning some money to bring my girlfriend to dinner, for example, go to <unk>
It was great man.
At some point I became interested in human form, sculptures of resin with drawings of human beings within layers.
It was great, except for one thing: <unk>
I didn't know what to do, because the resin was going to kill me.
And I went to bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried to use glass.
And I started drawing on the glass sheets, similar to the drawing in a window, then in another window, and then another window, and it had all these windows together that create a three-dimensional composition together.
And this really worked, and so I could stop using the <unk>
So I did this for years, and my work <unk> with something very big, I call <unk>
By <unk> I was inspired by the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> which is a painting at the Museum of <unk> in Spain.
Do you know it?
Well, it's a fantastic picture.
They say it's a bit ahead of your time.
Well, the <unk> <unk> this piece.
It weighs 11,000 pounds.
5.5 feet long.
It's got twice as a face, so it's 10 meters of composition.
It's a little weird.
Well, that's the source of blood.
On the left, she's Jesus and <unk>
There's a cave where all these creatures with animal heads travel between two worlds.
They go from the world of representation -- this <unk> mesh of <unk> where they were <unk>
Here is where creatures with animals are headed to <unk> lists for suicide <unk> in the ocean.
The ocean is comprised of thousands of elements.
This is a <unk> god tied to a <unk>
Billy Graham is in the <unk> The <unk> -- the <unk> -- the <unk> <unk> refuge in the <unk> shelter -- there are all kinds of weird things that you can find if you look very well in the ocean.
Anyway, also a kind of <unk>
It's coming out of the ocean, and it spits out oil in a hand while the other hand comes out clouds.
Their hands are like <unk> and it looks like a <unk> that keeps the Earth and the cosmos in balance.
So it's one aspect of <unk>
It's a little story.
That's the hand in which he <unk>
And then, when you go to the other side, it has a <unk> like a bird <unk> and it spits clouds from this <unk>
It also has a tail of 5.5 feet long a <unk> line that joins the <unk>
Anyway, your tail turns on fire by <unk> on a <unk>
I don't know why it happened.
Things that go in, you know.
His tail ends up in a <unk> eye of <unk> made from 1986.
They have <unk>
They did in the 1980s, as if they were baseball cards of the terrorists.
Very <unk> at the time.  This brings me to my last project.
I'm in the middle of two <unk> One is called <unk>
This is a six-year-old project to make 100 of these human beings.
Each one is an archive of our culture, through media and material are <unk> dictionaries or magazines.
But each one acts as a kind of archive in a form of human being, and they travel in groups of 20, four or 12 at the time.
They're like cells, they come together, they get together.
And you can walk between them. I'm getting years.
Each one is basically a carbon <unk> which weighs 1.3 pounds with a human stuck inside its inside.
This is a little cave in the chest.
That's the <unk> he's the chest, and you can get the <unk>
I'm going to accompany them for the rest of the body -- there's a waterfall that comes out of his chest, and he covers the penis or <unk> or whatever he has, a kind of <unk> thing.
It's a quick review of these works because I can't get it for a long time.
We have layers, you can see.
This is a game in half.
This is two heads, and it's communicating between the two.
There are some pills that come out and come into the head of this strange statue here.
There's a little forest scene inside the <unk> <unk>
They can <unk>
Anyway, this talk is about these <unk> just like the boxes that we live in.
We're in a box, the solar system is a box.
This brings me to my last box.
It's a brick. It's called <unk> <unk>
Within this box there is a physicist, a neuroscientist, a musician, a musician, a musician, a musician, a <unk> a museum, a school, an editorial arm that spreads all the content that we do in the world and a garden.
<unk> the box and all of the people in each other as it comes to each other as the particles.
And I think that's the way to change the world.
When you <unk> who is and the box that's living on.
And together we got to realize that we're all together in this, that this illusion that we are different -- these concepts of the countries of the boundaries, of religion, doesn't work.
We're all really made of the same matter and in the same box.
And if we don't start to exchange those things with sweetness and <unk> we're all going to die very soon.
Thank you very much.
What do you do when your head?
They take a <unk>
But so that this pill have effect effect on pain, first goes through the stomach, and other organs.
And I'll take a pill. It's the most effective system and <unk> so that any medicine is actually going to effect on the body.
The <unk> however, is that the <unk> any drug is <unk>
And this is a big problem, especially in patients with HIV.
When you take drugs that are being used to decrease the amount of viruses in blood, and increase the heart of stem cells.
But they are also known by their side effects -- in their most negative effects, because in time that it takes to get to the blood stream they will be <unk> and worse in the time that it takes to get to fate, which is where it's more important, in the warehouse of HIV.
These are regions of the body as the lymph Rouge <unk> the nervous system, the lungs, where the virus is <unk> and it doesn't get easily in the blood stream of patients that are <unk> to regulate therapy with antiretroviral drugs.
However, after the disruption of treatment, the virus can wake up and infect new cells.
This is the great deal of the treatment of HIV with the current drugs that is a treatment of life run by a lifetime to run by the time.
One day, I sat down, and I thought, "You know, <unk> to get the treatment directly into the virus, directly without the risk of <unk>
As a scientist in <unk> the answer was in front of me: <unk> of course.
If you use it in <unk> to care of wounds and surgery of diabetes, they can be used for anything else -- including <unk> transport of drugs.
In fact, we're already using pulses of laser in order to open up or drill holes -- that open up and shut down, almost immediately the cells infected with HIV to introduce drugs.
The best people are asking, "What is that <unk>
We sent a little bit powerful laser beam on the cellular membrane by HIV while these cells are embedded in a liquid that contains the drug.
The laser goes through the cell, while the cell absorbs the drug in a matter of microseconds.
Before you even realize it, the hole is <unk> immediately.
We're now testing this technology in vitro or <unk> <unk> but the goal is to take this technology to the human body, apply it to the human body.
"How is that <unk> you can ask.
Well, the answer is, through a <unk> device.
With the first head, which is our laser, we'll make a <unk> in the site of the infection.
The second head, which is a camera, it goes to the site.
Finally, the third head, a <unk> that distributes the drug, releases it directly into the site of infection, while the laser uses again to keep the cells open.
Well, this doesn't seem a lot of time.
But one day, if it's successful, this technology can lead to the total eradication of HIV in the body.
Yes. A cure for HIV.
This is the dream of all <unk> research in our case, a laser treatment.
Thank you.
In the last decade, I've studied armed groups -- not <unk> organizations like terrorists, insurgents or <unk>
<unk> what these groups do when they're not shoot 'n.
My goal is to understand better to these agents of violence, and study ways of encouraging the transition from violent participation to the confrontation aren't violent.
I make a field work in the world of politics and the library.
Understanding these groups is key to solving almost every conflict in course, because the war has changed.
It used to be a dispute between states.
It's not.
It's now a conflict between the states and non-state actors.
For example, the <unk> arrangements of 1975 and 2011, <unk> had signed up between a state and a non-governmental actor.
So we need to understand these <unk> we even need to be <unk> or <unk> in any process of successful conflict.
But how do you do that?
We need to know what motivates these organizations.
We know very well the reasons why they are doing it, but nobody analyzes what they do when they don't <unk>
The armed struggle and the policies were not <unk>
Everything is part of the same organization.
We cannot understand these groups, not much less <unk> without a global vision.
<unk> groups today are complex organizations.
For example, the <unk> <unk> known for its violent <unk> against the <unk>
From their creation in the 1980s, <unk> has also established a political party -- a network of social services and a military thing.
Similarly, Palestinian Palestinian <unk> known for their suicide attacks against Israel, also runs the <unk> of Gaza from 2007.
So these groups make more than just fire.
It's multitasking
<unk> a complex machinery of communication stations, radio radio stations, Internet websites and strategies in social networks.
And here you have the magazine <unk> magazine in English and published to <unk>
<unk> groups also invest in a complex fundraising fund without <unk> but through business <unk> for example, building companies.
These activities are key.
They allow these groups to increase their strength, increase their funding, to recruit better and build their brand.
<unk> groups also do something more, create stronger ties with their population by investing in social services.
They build schools, they run hospitals, they put in professional training programs or <unk>
<unk> offers all these services and more.
The armed groups are also trying to conquer the population by giving up something that is not <unk> security and protection.
The rise of the Taliban in a Afghanistan was torn by the war or even the beginning of <unk> <unk> can also be able to understand the efforts of these groups to provide security.
Unfortunately, in these cases, security has a high health price for the population.
But generally providing social services means filling up a vacuum, a <unk> gap by the government, and allow these groups to strengthen and increase their power.
For example, the election victory of 2006 from Palestinian Hamas can't understand without the social work of the group.
It's a really complex scenario even in the West, when we look at <unk> groups just think about the violent side.
But that's not enough to understand the strengths of these groups, the strategy or the long-term vision.
These groups are <unk>
<unk> because they fill up <unk> gaps by the government, and come up as armed groups and political groups, involved in the violent struggle and give governance.
And the more complex and the more sophisticated ones are these organizations, fewer we can <unk> it as opposed to a state.
How do you call a group like <unk>
You know, part of a territory, run all of its <unk> collect the trash, running the <unk> system.
It's a state? It's a <unk> group.
Or maybe it's something else, something new and different.
And what is <unk>
The lines are <unk>
We live in a world of states of nations without state and hybrids and the more weak ones are states, like in the Middle East and the more to fill that gap the non-state actors.
This is important for governments, because to counter these groups will have to invest more in the military tools.
<unk> that empty vacuum has to be at the center of any sustainable approach.
This is very important to establish and put the peace.
If we understand the groups -- we will better understand what incentives to offer to foster violence from violence to not violence.
In this new dispute between states and actors, actors, military power can win some <unk> but not to give us peace and stability.
In order to achieve these goals we need long-term investments to fill that safety gap.
Thank you.
I'm a failure as a woman and a feminist feminist.
My views about gender equality are <unk> but I'm afraid to accept <unk> <unk> tag would be <unk> for <unk>
I'm a feminist, but pretty bad.
And therefore I was scared as a bad feminist feminist.
Or, at least, I wrote a paper, and a book called "The <unk> and then in interviews, people started calling the <unk> <unk>
So what started as a personal joke meant to me and a <unk> <unk> has become a little bigger.
Let me give you a step back.
When I was young, especially in my youth and at the age of 20 years, I had strange ideas about the <unk> these women <unk> <unk> with men and that they were using sex.
Today, I see how women are treated all over the world and anger, in particular, seems like a perfectly reasonable answer.
But at the time, I was worried about the tone that I was using people to <unk> that might be a feminist feminist.
It will be labeled <unk> a <unk> a taboo word, a nasty word.
I love myself as a woman who doesn't follow the rules, which is asking too much, with high self-esteem and <unk> to believe it's equal to a man.
Nobody wants to be that woman <unk> until you realize that it's actually that woman and you can't imagine being another person.
Over time, as I grew up, I began to accept that I am, in fact, feminist, and also proud of it.
For me, certain claims are <unk> women are equal to men.
They would take the same wages for the same work.
We have a right to travel around the world like <unk> <unk> or violence.
We have a right to use it easy and accessible the contraceptives and the <unk> services.
We have the right to decide about our bodies, no need for <unk> or doctrines of <unk>
We have the right to respect.
There's more.
When you talk about the needs of women, you have to account at our other <unk>
We're not just women.
We are people with a different body, expression of gender, religion and <unk> and <unk> social condition, skills and much more.
We need to tell these differences and how we behave in the same way that matters what we have in common.
Without this kind of <unk> our feminism is nothing.
For me, these truths are <unk> but to be clear: I'm a disaster.
I'm full of contradictions.
There's a lot of things that make me a bad feminist feminist.
I have another confession.
When I lead to work, I hear rap music attached to all volume.
Though the letter degrades in the women, and it offends me deeply, the classic <unk> <unk> of the Yin yang <unk> is amazing.
<unk> reality with your <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> until you get <unk>
Think about it.
<unk> poetry, right?
I'm completely <unk> by my musical music.
I firmly believe in the work of man, which is all I don't want to do, <unk>  all of the <unk> tasks, but also killing insects, the collection of trash, the <unk> <unk> and <unk>
I don't want to have anything to do with that.
The pink is my favorite color.
<unk> from fashion magazines and nice things.
I can see "The <unk> and <unk> <unk> and I have erotic fantasies of the fairy fairy fairy fairy fairy <unk>
Some of my crimes are more <unk>
If a woman wants to adopt the last man of his husband, it's his choice, and I'm not one who for <unk>
If a woman decides to stay home to raise his kids, I hate that choice, too.
The problem is not that it becomes economically vulnerable through this same choice, the problem is that our society is <unk> so that it makes women economically vulnerable when they <unk>
It would take this problem.
<unk> liberal feminism that has bypassed or <unk> historically the needs of color women -- the gay <unk> and <unk> for white women, <unk> and <unk>
Listen, if that's good feminism is a very bad feminist feminist here.
Also what happens is this: As a feminist, I feel a lot of pressure.
We have this tendency to put <unk> <unk> in a <unk>
We hope that it will happen to perfection.
When we were excited about them with a very good taste of the same <unk> where the <unk>
As I said, I'm a <unk> I think I would be <unk> from that <unk> before trying to put me there.
<unk> women, particularly innovative and leaders of sector, are afraid of being tagged as <unk>
They have a fear of standing up and say, "Yes, I'm a <unk> because of what that tag means is because I don't have to be able to touch with little realistic.
Let's take for example <unk> or like I call it, the <unk>
In the last few years, it's a <unk> feminist feminist now.
In the <unk> Music Center in <unk> <unk> in front of the word <unk> of three meters tall.
It was a <unk> show to see this pop star to see this pop star and embrace feminism and to know women and young men who will be feminist is something to be proud of.
<unk> the time, the cultural critics had endless arguments if <unk> was or not precisely a feminist thing.
I would hear your feminism, instead of simply believing the word of an adult woman and <unk>
<unk> perfection of <unk> because we're still struggling for a lot, we want a lot, we need so much that we need a lot.
We are going to go beyond <unk> criticism and <unk> to <unk> the feminism of any woman, <unk> until there is nothing.
We don't need to do that.
<unk> or rather, an feminism more <unk> is the point of <unk>
But what happens next?
We went from recognizing our <unk> to give it to action and be a little more <unk>
If I listen to music, I am creating a demand for artists that would be happier to provide a <unk> supply.
These artists will not change their way to talk about women in their songs until they make change affecting change effectively their profit.
It's certainly hard.
Why has your music to be so <unk>
It's hard to choose something better and so easy to justify a worse choice.
But when bad decisions do this makes it more difficult for women to achieve the equality, the equality that we all deserve and is our responsibility.
I think of my three and four years.
They are two girls and <unk> and bright and also very brave. I want you to grow in a world.
Where they are being told by the strong creatures that they are.
I think of them, all of a sudden, the best choice will be <unk> as something much easier to do.
We can all make better decisions.
We can change the channel when a television program comes to sexual violence against women as a sport, to <unk> the Game of <unk>
We can change the radio <unk> when we hear songs that treat women like nothing.
We can spend our money to go to cinema in another part when movies don't treat women more than like <unk> objects.
We can stop supporting the professional sports sports where athletes deal with their fellow <unk>
In any case, men, especially young men, heterosexual men can say, "No, I'm not going to publish in your magazine, participate in your project, or working with you, until I don't include a number of women, so much to participate in how to make decisions.
I'm not going to work with you until your <unk> or your organization is more <unk> with a broader range of people."
Those of us who are <unk> but we want to engage in this kind of projects, we can also be able to become even more as much as we can be <unk> to overcome the barriers to the decision.
Because we are not <unk> because of these efforts, without the <unk> our accomplishments are going to mean very little.
We can make these little acts of courage and hope that our decisions will come to the top of the people in the power directors and movie producers and music and music, <unk> the <unk> the people who can make great decisions, more courageous, to create a durable and significant change.
We can also claim with courage our feminism, -- well, bad, or any <unk>
The last line of my book <unk> <unk> says, <unk> will be a bad feminist to not <unk>
This is true because of many reasons, but I say, most of all, because <unk> my voice was <unk> and feminism helped me <unk>
There was one incident.
I call it incident to do in front of what happened.
A few kids told me when I was very young, and I didn't know that kids can do this to a girl.
They treated me as if it was nothing.
I started to believe that it was nothing.
I get my voice, and after all I was not forced to believe that I could say something that might matter.
But I was writing.
And I went back to <unk>
I became a stronger version of myself.
And the words of those women who could understand a story like mine, and the women who looked like me and understood what meant to live in this world if you have the brown skin.
The words of the women who showed me that was nothing.
I learned to write as them, and then I learned to write like myself.
I found my voice again, and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond what you can measure.
Through writing and feminism, and I also found that if I was a bit brave -- another woman could hear me and see me and realize that none of us is anything that the world is trying to tell us that we are.
In one hand, I have the power to achieve anything.
And in the other, I have a <unk> reality that I'm just a woman.
I'm a bad feminist, I'm a good person, I'm a good woman, I'm trying to improve my way to think, what I say and what I do, without leaving everything that makes me human.
I hope we could all do the same.
I hope that we could all be a little brave when you need such a <unk>
Just after Christmas of last year, <unk> children in California had <unk> to have been <unk> or to be exposed to someone who had been there.
The virus then went through the border of Canada, <unk> to over 100 children in <unk>
One of the <unk> things about this outbreak is that the <unk> that can be lousy for a child with a immune immune system, is one of the most likely diseases in the world.
There's an effective vaccine against this for over half a century -- but many of the children involved in the <unk> outbreak had not been vaccinated because their parents were afraid of something supposed to be still <unk>
But a moment, was not the article that sparked the controversy about autism and vaccines will happen, and it has been a fraud fraud by the British Medical School.
Not the majority of intelligent scientists that vaccines cause autism is a <unk>
I think most of you know, but millions of fathers around the world are still <unk> that vaccines will pay in danger to their children from having autism.
Why?
Here's why.
This is a graph of the increase of autism in time.
For the most part of the 20th century, autism considered a very strange disease.
And the few psychologists and pediatricians who had heard about it create their own professional life without seeing one case.
For decades, the prevalence estimates were continued to only three or four children per <unk>
But then, in the 1990s, numbers started <unk>
Out of fundraising finance as <unk> <unk> they refer to autism as an epidemic as if I could get it from another child in <unk>
What's going on?
If you're not the vaccines, what is it?
If you ask the people at the Center for Disease Control what's going on, tend to be based on phrases like <unk> of diagnostic diagnosis, and <unk> <unk> to explain these figures <unk>
But that kind of language don't <unk> a lot of the fears of a young mother who looks for the face of his son of two years, the eye contact of it.
If the diagnostic criteria had to come up, why were they so <unk> at the beginning?
Why were the cases of autism so hard to find before the decade of <unk>
Five years ago, I decided to discover the answers to these questions.
I learned that what happened has less than to do with slow progress and <unk> of science that with the evil power of storytelling.
For the most part of the 20th century, the doctors told a story about what autism and how autism was discovered, but that story turned out to be fake, and the consequences of the same are having a devastating impact on global public health.
There was a second more accurate story of autism that had been lost and forgotten in the dark corners of the clinical literature.
This second story tells us all about how we get here and where we need to go.
The first story begins with a children's psychiatrist Leo <unk> at Johns Hopkins Hospital. In Johns Hopkins Hospital.
They could have fun during hours by waving their hands in front of his faces, but they were suspended from panic by <unk> as he didn't put his favorite toy in your usual place without knowing them.
Over the basis of the patients in their clinic, <unk> <unk> that autism is very weird.
For the 1950s, as the main authority of the world in the subject, stated that he had seen less than 150 true cases of their syndrome as we were using references from places as distant as South Africa.
This is actually not surprisingly, because the criteria of <unk> for autism diagnosis were very <unk>
For example, <unk> giving that diagnosis to children with seizures but now we know that epilepsy is very common in autism.
Once he had turned out that he had become nine of every 10 children sent for other doctors to his office by being autistic without giving them a diagnosis of autism.
<unk> was a smart man, but part of his theories were not <unk>
<unk> autism as a form of child suffering caused by cold, cold parents.
These kids, he said, they've stayed carefully at a refrigerator and not <unk>
At the same time, though, <unk> noticed that some of their young patients had special skills that cluster in certain areas like music, mathematics and memory.
One of the kids in their clinic could tell between 18 <unk> before I turned two years.
When his mother put one of his favorite records. He correctly said, <unk>
But <unk> had a bad opinion of these skills, saying things like children were just <unk> what they had heard of their parents who were desperate to win their approval.
As a result, autism became a source of shame for families, and two generations of autistic children were sent to institutions for their own well, becoming invisible to the world in general.
Amazingly, it wasn't until the 1970s that researchers started to test the theory theory that autism was weird.
<unk> <unk> the cognitive psychologist in London, I thought that the theory of the mothers who were <unk> by <unk> was pretty stupid.
She and her husband John were warm people and <unk> and they had a deep autistic daughter called <unk>
<unk> and John knew how hard it was to raise a little girl as a little girl, and without special education, no special education, and no access to other resources without a diagnosis.
To defend for the National Health Service, they needed more resources for young children and their families, <unk> and their colleague Judith Gould decided to do something that should be done 30 years before.
They did a prevalence study of autism in the general population.
I took a suburb from London called <unk> to try to find children autistic in the community.
What they saw was that the model of <unk> was too limited, because the reality of autism was so much more <unk> and diverse as well.
Some kids could not speak at all, while others were <unk> in their fascination with astrophysics on dinosaurs or the dinosaurs <unk>
In another way, these kids didn't fit a nice <unk> and <unk> as they said, and they saw a lot of them, much more than the <unk> model of <unk> would have predicted.
At first, they were lost by trying to make sense of your data.
How did nobody ever realize these kids before?
But then <unk> I found a reference to an article published in German in <unk> the next year, and then he was able to, buried under the ashes of a terrible time that nobody wanted to remember.
<unk> I knew about this article from competition, but I avoided <unk> in his own work.
There was not even a translation in English, but luckily, the husband of <unk> talking German, and he was doing it for her.
The document is offering an alternative story of autism.
His author was a man named Hans <unk> who ran a clinical clinic in Vienna, in the 1930s.
<unk> ideas for teaching children with learning differences were <unk> even for contemporary standards.
The morning in their clinic started with computer exercises with music, and the kids followed their games on Sunday afternoon.
Instead of blaming the parents of causing autism, Asperger's as disability as disability in life that required <unk> forms of support and <unk> space for the course of life.
Instead of dealing with children in their clinic as patients, Asperger's called her little teachers, and he got to help the development of methods that were especially right for them.
And the <unk> has seen autism as a continual diverse spread that included an amazing variety of gifts, and disability.
He believed that autism and the autistic traits were common, and they've always been, looking at aspects of this continuous <unk> in the pop culture like the awkward social scientist and the awkward <unk>
He was beyond even to say, that for success in science and art, a little bit of autism is essential.
<unk> and Judith found that <unk> found that <unk> found that autism was <unk> as well as the parents were the <unk>
Over the next few years, they worked in silence with the American Association of <unk> to extend the criteria of the diagnosis that reflect the diversity of what they called <unk> <unk>
By the end of the '80s and the early '90s, their changes came into <unk> <unk> the limited model of <unk> by a broad and <unk>
These changes were not on broken <unk>
<unk> when <unk> and Judith worked between <unk> to reform these <unk> people around the world see an autistic adult for the first time.
Before I went out <unk> <unk> in 1988, just a small circle, <unk> by experts knew what autism, but after the <unk> performance of <unk> <unk> as <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> with four prizes of the <unk> <unk> psychologists, psychologists, <unk> and parents all over the world knew what the autism.
At the same time, they introduced early clinics to diagnose autism.
I didn't have to have a connection with that little circle of experts to get a diagnosis for his son.
The combination of <unk> <unk> the changes in the criteria and the introduction of these tests created a network, a perfect storm of consciousness of autism.
The number of diagnoses started <unk> the same as they predicted <unk> and <unk> in fact they hoped that this is what it was going to be able to make the people with autism and their families finally <unk> the support and services that are <unk>
So Andrew <unk> came to blame vaccines for the increase in <unk> and a simple, powerful history and <unk> story as bad as the <unk> theory of autism was <unk>
If the current estimate of the prevention of the prevention of every 68 children in America are in the spectrum, it's right, the autistic groups are one of the world's largest <unk> groups.
Over the last few years, people are autistic people have joined the Internet to reject the idea that the puzzles are going to be solved by the new medical advances -- to celebrate the term <unk> to celebrate the varieties of human cognition.
One way to understand <unk> is to think about terms of human operating systems.
The fact that a PC doesn't work with Windows doesn't mean it's <unk>
According to the <unk> standards, the normal human brain is easily <unk> social <unk> and they suffer from a attention deficit to details.
Certainly people are autistic people have difficulty living in a world not built for them.
70 years later, we're still reaching <unk> which creates the <unk> for the most successful aspects of autism are in understanding of teachers, employers with capacity, communities, communities and parents with faith in the potential of their children.
An autistic woman named <unk> <unk> once said, "We need all the hands on cover to <unk> the ship of the <unk>
As you go into an uncertain future, we need all the forms of human intelligence on the planet to address the challenges that we face as a society.
We cannot afford to lose a brain.
Thank you.
